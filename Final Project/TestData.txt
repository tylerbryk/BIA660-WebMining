i have purchase this player in april because i went to a wedding to california. it worked and when i bought in april and in may i came back and three (3) months later in july the battery is not holding so i had to call lexar for a replacement and they did send me a replacement. i got the replacement in august and then guess what happen agian? yes the battery will not hold again. this is ridiculous. i mean the new one is a lemon and the exchange one is lemon too. lexar makes cheap cheap cheap things except for memory. the shouldn't make mp3 players anymore and just stick with making memory. like the i-pods and other manufactures who uses a built in rechargeable battery and when the battery dies your screwed. if they say pay $30-60 to replace a battery i rather buy a new mp3. if you get there extended service plans that is crazy you can even but a new one if you get there extended service. think about about it when you're buying mp3 players. my suggestion is buy an mp3 player that uses batteries like for a walkman or rechargeable batteries for cameras because once they die you can get batteries at a cheaper price. i am going to refund my money for my player. don't ever buy from lexar or any other compnies that uses built in rechargeable batteries.  nothing good about this player.  rechargeable batter (built in) always dieing every three months. think about it after the warranty is over what are you going to do with it. you're stuck.  
the archos unit is very hard to operate and tech ser are not very helpful when you need them.  
after 3 months now only one speaker on the headphone works,no way to fix that.  
once again, sony delivers marvelous hardware with marginal software (see also their line of digital cameras that lacks windows 2000 support). this player, the physical unit itself, is excellent: conveniently small, well-styled and lightweight, with a nice display for a small device. the sound quality is excellent (good bass!). for the price, a 128meg memory stick would have been nice. i haven't personally purchased a second memory stick yet, but potential buyers should be aware that they can be a bit expensive and hard to find (see the other reviews). overall, however, i like the hardware and have no serious complaints.<br><br> the software is another matter entirely. i expected that it would be fairly straightforward to add and remove songs with this device: i assumed that when the player was attached with a usb cable, windows would simply recognize it as an extra drive, with normal copy/delete functionality. unfortunately, this is not the case. the only way sony allows the user to interact with the player is through a software package called openmg jukebox. this jukebox not only plays songs and maintains playlists, but it also &quot;optimizes&quot; songs in different music formats for use on the player. &quot;optimize&quot; is a misnomer here, as it implies that the operation is an optional way to improve performance (maximize storage, increase sound quality, etc), whereas in reality only music &quot;optimized&quot; to sony's proprietary format works on the player.<br><br> since the vast majority of users maintain their digital music collections in mp3 format, this creates quite a dilemma. either the user 1) stays with mp3 and converts songs &quot;on the fly&quot; to omg, sony's format, as he puts them on the player (this greatly increases the time needed to copy songs to the player) or the user 2) maintains two copies of all his songs, one in mp3 and one in omg (this obviously consumes drive space rather quickly) or the user 3) converts all his music to omg, and is forced to use openmg (rather than the mp3 player of his choice) to listen to it. none of these options is particularly appealing.<br><br> i am torn on the &quot;final verdict&quot; for this product. the hardware easily deserves five stars. as for the software, i sympathize with sony's desire to fight music piracy (though i think their motives are probably more financial than moral). however, i believe that the protections put in place through the use of their proprietary format do far more to mar an otherwise excellent piece of hardware than they do to prevent piracy. anyone determined to pirate music can still do so, at the cost of a little extra disk space or a few more minutes, and those users who, for instance, only have mp3's ripped from their own cd's (which does not constitute piracy) are still forced to accept the inefficiencies inherent in any proprietary format. in the end, sony's software only succeeds in causing music pirates a minor inconvenience, at the cost of giving all their users headaches. so sadly, i must give this well-designed product a rating far lower than it deserves.  
i wanted a device like this; something that i could plug into my computer and access just like a thumb drive. when i took it out of the package, there was a cd that came with it, but as i looked at the cd and the standard usb jack in the side, i thought "i'll just plug it in and see what happens." that's what i did, and i was able to drop a few folders on it and listen to music immediately. i never installed the software. in this case windows xp didn't have a problem with drivers or anything.  more things need to be like this. itunes and the other software interfaces that are required by other players are a hindrance. proprietary cables should be banned, as far as i'm concerned. this simple unit uses a usb cable and a headphone jack, and that's all you need. you can put it in your pocket without discomfort. it's solid state (no spinning disk harddrive) so the risk of damage to the unit is minimal.  the battery doesn't last long, and there is no hardware to run this off a car charger as far as i've found. i am irritated that to use this in the car, i must have at least three separate wires going from this to that, which is very annoying, and i'm still running down the battery. i've yet to find a cigarette-lighter mounted fm transmitter with a "line-in" jack all consoldiated into a single unit. this would rid my car of these dumb wires all over the place. since the screen is small, you have to fiddle with it while driving which is a pain, but to be expected for something this small.  until i find something better, i'll stick with this quick and easy mp3 solution.       
plz dont take this product....bcoz it has no sign of usb at all....when u connect it to the system....it shows no sign that it is connected...  
i rate this product ++ compared to shuffle. it has a very nice and sexy looking display. no need to say about music quality. earplug coming with this player is of cheap quality. would suggest for a better quality headfones.   
i just bought this a few days ago. everything is fine, but the battery seems so short. i charged it with an ac adapter from gomadic and i definitely don't get 15 hours! i goes past the half way mark in about 3 hours and that is lame, but i do play around with it a lot. i also don't like the volume control. it's really hard to press and it should've just been part of the joystick.   
i bought this about 2 yrs ago and it has worked perfectly.  outstanding picture and very user friendly.  downloads from dvr rapidly.  has good battery life.  much better than keeping up with portable dvd players and discs.  compact for travel.  i have only had it "freeze up" once and i just held the off button down until it rebooted.  worked perfectly after that.  highly recommend.  hopefully price will come down as with all electronics that are new....still a good purchase.  
the ipod with just one gb so what about the size, what i have read on the reviews seems that the nano is awesome and i got one the other day on apple and i got an engraving and i put (i have a rich uncle who loves me) so i think instead of shopping here for a ipod nano go to apple to get an engraving!  
i love iriver products, and was blown away with the sound on this player, but i had unresolvable problems with the player and windows media 10. i downloaded the "fix" from the iriver site, but i just couldn't get it to work without re-running the "fix" over and over again. finally, i returned the player to best buy, severely disappointed.  they need to create a new version of iriver music manager as an alternative so one can just drag and drop the songs from your hard drive to the player. the windows media 10 is incomprehensible to use; and the connectivity "for sure" is not sure at all! furthermore, the documentation doesn't explain how to get photos on the player. wm 10 placed them on the file system, but the only way to see them was to use the file "browser" on the h10. another problem was that the playlists were all "out" of sequenced from the alphabetical order i created on wm10. (this was when i could get the wm10 to recognize it). after awhile, i couldn't get wm10 to connect to the h10 at all.  calls to the tech support line yielded busy signals for 2 days. my email to customer service has yet to be answered.  this has soured me from purchasing iriver products for some time. too bad for them.....  
i bought one for 124.00 and i used it all of three days went online and got the update for the drivers and it froze on the start up screen so i have a very expensive paper weight.  
i have read alot of the reviews on the iriver, and i can only surmise that : some of these people do not own the iriver player, or they work for ipod. somebody said that the sound was muffled. well they must work for ipod. all digital sound is clean. it's the bit rate that plays a large part in the quality of the sound, and the speakers you hear it thru.  iriver has terrible earphones. i use the sony mdr series and the sound is very crisp. after all what you hear is the speakers, not the mp3 player. some people have said that iriver overstated the battery life. in the manual it say's that 16 hours of battery life is expected at 128 bit rate. most of my music is between 192 and 600 bit rate. do i get 16 hours of battery life? i don't know, as i charge it when i've used half of the life. for me that's about 5 hours of useage.  don't let big industry (ipod) convince you that they make a better mousetrap, that's just hype.       
this is the crappiest mp3 player ever. some problems encountered:  -it froze within a week of purchase -constantly freezes while playing music. -goes dead often (refuses to switch on) -constantly jams while downloading music, or, -a screen pops up on my computer stating that the usb port could not be detected, when it is actually connected securely. -battery life only lasted 4-5 hours, not the 10 hours philips claims. -constabtly jams while charging the player.   i'm surprised a reputable brand like philips has gotten away with such a shoddy product. i truly regret buying this product. if you're thinking of buying this product, i would suggest you second that thought and get yourself a creative zen micro instead.  
1) no ums (ie. does not appear as drive leter) - a pain as i can't double click a file on the player which i can see in windows explorer and hear it - i must copy it to pc 1st. btw m. okamoto, it deserves the bad rap it's getting about no ums - i hope samsung wake up & fix it in a new firmware release. 2) only found out about not having to install unwanted samsung media studio from amazon (which i'm grateful for) after installing it. 3) won't record from fm radio. 4) still beeps with hold on if accidentally push buttons - not logical (no i don't want to turn off beep completely)  mh   
i have one of these, and i am on my 3rd time trying to get it fixed. the hard drive has issues. first one locked up completely no warning. the replacement, stopped playing, then the replacement for the replacement right out of the box from creative wouldn't even power up and i can't even get them to send me a replacement for the one that was bad that they sent to me.  on a good note. i can say that once u figure out how the software works it is a very good player to have. lots of songs held, but when it crashes better have backups cause u r going to lose everything.   
don't even bother!    it keeps freezing up, turning off, and won't sync with any of my mp3s.  samsung was very unhelpful and said that it was "a windows/microsoft problem" when i reported when the device was starting to sync, then caused windows media player to shut down (on 2 seperate systems!) entirely and then the usb cord is faulty, saying that it is unplugged when it is not.    instructions were incomplete and shoddy.    try a zen player or a rio.  those at least work right out of the box, plug in the usb, and you're off.    
with all that already written, there is no doubt its the best player in market. i read the reviews and got this item and boy !!! its laden with features that actually work....  this is the mp3 player of players !!!  
when i first got this player, i thought it was great, and  had more features than an ipod. then i realized the  player is extremely incosistent and frustrating. all the connections are cheap... more than half the time i would leave the player overnight plugged into an outlet to charge, and in the morning it would not be charged at all; after a couple of months the headphone jack had a poor connection so my sound went in and out, and the usb connection was also poor, so i constantly have to plug the player  in and out for my computer to recognize the player as connected so i can upload songs.  after the headphone connection went from bad to worse i mailed it to get fixed since it was under the one year warranty. i had to pay over $20 for shipping and insurance on it, and didnt have my player for about a month, when i got it back they had replaced my player with a refurbished one. well that one didnt work at all.  when i called them to talk about it, they said i am not under phone service warranty , and i would have to give them my credit card # and pay $10 in order to discuss the problem.  they blame the problem on my computer, saying all my 6 usb ports must not be working and that is why i can't upload songs to it. yet they  dont seem to understand that i dock my digital comaera to the usb ports, as well as my boyfriends ipod, and there is no problems with the usb connection. they just cant think that their product doesnt work. so now after spend $200 on this product i have no mp3 player, and it has been so frustrating that i prefer throwing it in the garbage i guess i should go get an ipod, because there is a reason why they are so popular.   
this is my first mp3 player, i have to say it's been a good experience. with patience i figured out the program that came with it. (my biggest concern after reading reviews)the battery lasts forever and the sound is good, although i think i have noticed a skip or two lately, and the ear buds are painfull and short, get some new ones. i think this a good product for the price and does a good job.  
if you take a magnificent piece of hardware and put horrible software, what do you get?  junk!!!  the hardware construction of this product is outstanding!  the software is absolutely useless!!!  pro's: - sound quality is amazing for coming from such a small package.  speakers are only about 1.5" in diameter, but deliver the sound of a large boombox!  (almost seems like the bose cube speakers) - size is incredibly small for such a huge-sounding device (7" w x 2" d x 2.5" h) - stylish with a clear-on-white body finish (very apple-ish style) - battery life is very good -- it has always lasted through lengthy cook-outs (labor day, etc.) and is a great way to bring big music to a party without wires. - carrying case looks like it will take a beating and protect the unit.  con's: - software is horrible!  it requires that you install their version of musicmatch.  no other way to get music onto it.  even then, you have to jump through many hoops to get it to work -- very frustrating!!! - 256 mb of memory - radio reception is terrible (can't get anything, even with the antenna) - usb 1.1 takes about 30 minutes to load the full 256 mb with music - sporatic crashing (must be reset by jamming a paperclip into a rubber nub in the back) - ruberized door on back has cheap snap-shut clips that break off within a few uses (back panel is always open now)  once you've suffered through the painful music loading process, you will swear never to change the music on this thing again!  however, with only 256 mb, you will soon be tired of what seems like 10 songs over, and over again.  to sum it up, the concept for this unit has great potential -- but not the way it's implemented!  sound is great and awesome for bbq's, beach, etc.  philips needs to make it compatible with other software products and allow track drag-and-drop onto the device.  windows media player will not work on this.  
i bought it because i have an alienware computer and have been very happy with it, this has been a good player but not on the same level as their computers.  it playes mp3s, it has been durable, will it change the world or set the bar... no, but it was fair price.  
since the firts day i saw it, i knew it was going to be a great product. i just bought mine here on amazon.com!!!  what a terrific idea! i think it's going to be the standard for music, not only for the people that are  &quot;on-line&quot;but everybody as well. i highly recommend it!  
this product worked well for 5 workouts.  then the buttons stopped working.  new batteries didn't help. still, it was cheap and i understand the whole mp3 thing now.  i'll buy something better next.  
i have had the pleasure of owning a zen touch for the past three years now! the only problem i have had to date is that i lost the power adapter; seriously, that's it!  the zen touch has solid construction (i've dropped it several times), is easily navigable, has great sound and has an amazing file capacity. i tried to get into the i-pod hype, but saw so many other cost effective alternatives; i thought i would try to make mac work harder for my affection (not even the i-phone has swayed me yet).  although i am a subscriber to sirius satellite radio and make huge use of the stiletto that boasts a pretty sizable mp3 capacity itself (along with recorded radio files and internet radio capability), i still use my zen touch heavily for work at our after school programs.  i would go to bat for the zen touch any day (although i don't think creative makes them any more). i will use my zen until they start downloading music directly to my brain... we, even then the zen would probably be way more reliable (i've had to reboot the old noggin quite a few times since i work with kids).   
slick little mp3 player, easy to use, but battery died if i went more than 48 hours without playing it.  this is my 6th mp3 player, and one of 4 i have in use, but i decided to rreturn it to the store.   
this works great the battery lasts a long time.  the only problem with it is that it says it can hold 500 songs but in reality it only holds about half of that -i think it's due to the length of the music files some may be larger than others-they should tell you that or make it completely compatable to hold 500 songs no matter what.  other than that i love it-it is so small and the sound quality is great!  i would recommend this product it's great!  
i was looking for a small cheap mp3 player and i didn't care how much memory it had so this seemed perfect for me. i saw that many people had rated this 4 and 5 stars so i decided to buy it. when i got the creative nano i was really happy with its preformance until i tried to put my subscription music onto it. thats when i learned that it wouldn't hold any subscription music forcing me to buy my music one by one which is costing a lot of money.  after that i started realising all of its imperfections. you can't use the fm radio in the car without hearing mostly static. you can't search through songs without actually changing the song you are listening to. don't get me wrong, there are some good sides to this mp3 player but i still would definately not recommend it.  
i bought my ipod photo 60gb last week and it gave me a lot of problems from the start.   i charged the battery for over 5 hrs until fully charged and 5 mins later the ipod was telling me to charge again saying the battery was empty.  i got a new replacement within 3 days and charge the battery to full.  the next day i was listening to my ipod for almost 2hrs & 15 mins and the battery icon was down to red meaning the battery was almost empty.  this didn't make me happy at all when the ipod was suppose to last anywhere from 12-15 hrs.  i will return the 2nd ipod i got from amazon.  too bad....i really wanted to keep it, but with the battery trouble....i'm returning it.    
an excellent item. the only drawback is that the system does not receive radio signals very well without something plugged in acting like an antenna. when the antenna or the power cord are plugged in reception is good but bad otherwise.  
had this mp3 player two weeks and the volume up botton stopped working, i took the player apart and resoldered the micro switch and that solved the problem.   as i'm electronic technician this wasen't much of a problem for me but to all others considering  this product beware the construction of this thing is hardly rugged. on the plus side it has great sound and the battery life is pretty good, it also supports low bitrate files which is why i bought it.  hope my little review helps with your buying decision.  
i bought three of these items and with in two weeks all three began to malfunction ,the fm radio function stopped working and the player kept switching on and off rendering it useless.the only funtion remained partially working is the flash drive memory option.    
i like the sleek and elegant design of this player. with the ability to play mp3s, listen to radio with many presets, view limited video and pictures and text files along with being a digital voice recorder, this model has many features for the price. my only real complaint is not with the player itself but with the file management software that comes with it. i have two apple ipods but use them predominantly for podcasts. the samsung media software does not aggregate many different media elements into one central location like itunes does. i found it very difficult to find and download podcasts for this player. the sound quality is as good as apple if not better, and for music, it may be just great. due to this limitation of the software, i did not get as much enjoyment as others might. for me, it is an expensive digital voice recorder and fm radio. i did give it four stars because it has great potential and looks and sounds nice.     
i needed an mp3 player that would allow picture storage especially during travel. my wife takes a lot of pictures. the concept of wolverine seemed great. no propriatory software, direct download from multiple card formats, music player, video etc. when i received it i was definitely disappointed with the size. it is a brick!!!!!. they do not offer any decent carrying cases that would allow easy access while walking etc and protect it at the same time, like some cases for the ipod. the only one on their accessory list is very unappealing. these are minor things. i ordered mine from costco. it took 2 weeks to arrive and did not work. after an hour with a support representative (very good and patient) we could not make my two different computers recognize the device. they offered to send me a replacement one but i declined. i am not sure we started off on the right foot. i hope they make some adjustments in the size and software. i may give it a second chance some time in the future. for now i got a phillips gogear 8gb for music, radio while jogging and we will continue to use our old portable cd burner to transfer photos. by the way gogear is great and beats comparable ipods hands down as far as both price and features.  
i bought the sony hd3 in lieu of the ipod because of all the reviews i read stating that sony had the best sound. i was not disapointed with the sound--it's amazing. however, i had to exchange it after only four days because the flimsy power button bent when my fingernail accidentally slipped under it. the power button on this device is very thin and should anything get caught underneath it, it will easily bend. this is something sony should consider modifying with the hd5 that is scheduled to be out this year.   also: the software is not the best but not as bad as some reviews would lead you to believe.   the best reason to buy this mp3 player: the sound--it's awesome. also the battery life is a plus but don't count on getting 30 hours unless you convert to the sony format.   
at first i thought it was a pretty nice little mp3 player, although the 60 songs it holds has always been a thorn in my side. i didn't mind converting everthing over to real player since it doesn't play itunes, however, after about three months i had to change the battery...after changing the battery, the mp3 player would randomly shut off, which became a constant problem after every battery change, though eventually the problem would solve itself. approximately a year later, the battery cover was also constantly falling off for no apparent reason. now, about a year and a half since purchase, it has completely died, only playing about two minutes worth before shutting off on its own and refusing to reboot for several minutes. it's a great player for the price, but i would have liked something a little more dependable with a larger memory.  
easy to use.  tiny.  light.  fine sound.  lots of features.  excellent sw included.  plugs right in to usb (no cable to lose).  built-in fm radio.  runs on 1 aaa battery.  long battery life.  great price.  what's not to love?        
my wife owns the sandisk 256k (red) flash player which is great, so i figured i'd try this one. after all, it's the same company. plus, it's a 512k flash player plus expansion at virtually the same price as the standard 512k flash player. what a mistake! the standard sandisk flash player is solidly built, has an intuitive design, easy to use buttons (even if small), a clear bright blue display, and great sound quality (even when using mp3s at 128kbs). the sansa has none of these virtues. it is incredibly flimsy; the buttons are nearly impossible to use, the battery door is made of tissue thin plastic and constantly falls off, the sound quality is rotten, and once you put the plastic case on you'll never get if off. further, while the sandisk mp3 flash player plays tracks in the order you place them in the player (very efficient), the sansa seems incapable of playing songs in anything but alphabetical order, a real problem for someone like myself who likes eclectic music: (one track "paint it black" by the stones; next track "the prophecy" from "the fellowship of the rings soundtrack"!) on top of this my unit was defective. the lock would lock the sound volume only temporarily. suddenly music would blare out and nearly bust my eardrums; next i could barely hear a thing. pure garbage. get the regular sandisk mp3 flash player or get an ipod for twice the price and a thousand times the value. this product is pure junk!!!!  
i consider myself a well-versed computer user and have used a few mp3 players in my time, including my current 30gb creative zen vision m. i purchased (2) iriver t30 players for my daughters christmas presents in 2006. both napster and iriver expressed that these players were compatible with the napster to go service. i made the choice to purchase based on their compatibility and price, but i forgot the old saying, "you get what you pay for!"  i have not succeed with downloading any music into either of these players as of yet. both have very old firmware installed and for whatever reason, will not accept the new updated firmware. and yes, i know about having to run xp with service pack 2...that is exactly what my computer is running. after contacting both iriver 3 times and the seller 4 times, i still have not reached a satisfactory agreement for replacement. i would feel differently if only one player had issues, but both are unusable and i would never recommend this product to anyone. i would, however, recommend creative zen products. they are high quality, sturdy and the company stands behind everything they sell, not like other companies that hide when problems occur.  
creative labs nomad ii mp3 player. do not buy this product! i initially bought this unit because it had &quot;name&quot; &amp; several good reviews.  you can imagine my dissatisfaction when the actual product arrived &amp; did not live up to expectations. ok, the first nomad unit that i received was a total failure. nothing worked. the rechargeable batteries could not be recharged, the &quot;docking station&quot; was &quot;fubar,&quot; and the player simply did not work. ok. trust the company.  send the unit back &amp; get a new one. did that. got a new unit. guess what? worked for four hours &amp; then stopped, shut down, quit, for no identifiable reason. frustration. conclusion. do not buy this product. for whatever reason, design, quality control, whatever, this product is fubar.  it is totally unreliable! do not buy it! do not waste your money!  
i gave the lifedrive a chance for a year.   it was my 2nd palm device.   the old tungsten e was more reliable.  even though the tungsten e would lose data once the battery drain, i knew how to work around it...use backup software and charge it every other day.  once i knew how to work around the tungten e's quirks then it became a reliable hardware for me.  i do not know how to work around lifedrive's quirks.  the lifedrive worked most of the time, but you always had a sense that it may not work one day and you are not clear how to fix it or prevent some issues from happening again.   sometimes it would not come on even though the day before it was fully charged.   i had to charge it again for some reason.   my current problem is that when i turn it on i can only see my contacts and the wifi screen seems to be in loop (keeps flashing on and off).   it will not let me use any other applications.  i reset it and nothing has changed.  i should have went with the palm tx instead.  palm owes buyers an apology for creating such an expensive item that is not reliable.  
i purchased my zen player with high hopes that were ultimately crushed by their technical support.  i am a pretty savvy, techno-geek but i met my match with the mp-3 player from creative.  after experiencing set up problems, i contacted their tech. support.   i spoke to a friendly girl who seemed to be dazed by even the smallest technical problem which she was obviously enslaved to answer.  i asked to talk to a supervisor.  when i was told i would be contacted in 24 hours by a supervisor to clear the problem, i returned the product.  i never heard back from the girl's supervisor, nor was the problem ever resolved.  
i purchased the gigabeat after reading the reviews about this unit being the "ipod killer". first, what i don't like about the unit. the battery, the battery, the battery! if apple can make a battery life on the ipod that last 20 hours, why can't other manufacturers?  the first week i got the gigabeat the battery lasted 5 hours, then 4, then 2. now it doesn't turn on. i had to send back to toshiba for repair. i am not happy. where are the accessories? how can you beat the ipod without accessories? price - if you want to beat the king you have to be better than the king especially in price.  in operations. if you are not careful you can delete all the music on the player.   now here is the good: the unit sounds great, nice size screen, works well with media player, easy to use.   the bottom line: this is not an "ipod killer". i should have gotten an ipod!!  
i purchased the sansa view mainly because of the 16 gb capacity, and found the operation to be rather confusing. the instruction "manual" is no help whatsoever, so i was left to fend for myself.  it took me an entire day to figure out how to turn the infernal thing off, and after the player froze on me, i decided that this was cutting edge technology that hadn't yet cut out all the blips.  i returned it, and  i'm much happier with the more compact sandisk e280.  
i have one of these. it worked fine for a few months, but then the on/off button started having problems. sometimes i just can't turn it off. i will think twice before i buy an apple product next time.  
this player is junk. it advertises all these features and it probably has them, if you can find one that will work more than twice. i bought one and it worked twice and wouldn't come back on. i called the seller they gave me a rma number and i returned it. i thought that maybe i just got a bad player so i asked for an exchange, which i got with no problem. i did have to pay six dollars shipping for the return though. a couple of weeks later got a new player. it worked a whopping two times before it quit. i knew it would be six more dollars shipping so i threw it in the trash...which is where every one of these players by audiovox belongs as far as i am concerned. the only reason i gave it one star is because i don't think i can give it a zero. know this product is a zero in my opinion. it is just terrible.  
i love my creative zen. i have downloaded a bunch of music easily and have been enjoying it since i recieved it. i highly recommend it as a more affordable version of the ipod.   
this is a great, simple mp3 player.  i don't mean simple as in it's features because it has some that an ipod doesn't have, but simple as in easy to use.  it took me 5 minutes to download the software, get it hooked up and started ripping cds. i am a busy parent and to me, i-tunes is just way too much work.  with this, you put in a cd, push a button on the docking cradle and that's it, it does the rest.    
dell should stick with its dayjob: pcs & printers. portable music devices, is just not their thing. i first bought the dell dj 5g: endless problems with it - every problem you could think of. i have made numerous phone calls to their tech support, spent hours trying to repair it - five units later, they sent me the dell 20 (the price went down, which was equal to the original price i paid).  so - i have the dell 20g, and it does not work with napster. i have spent hours with napster tech support - uninstalled and reinstalled napster, drm files, windows media player; everything they told me to do - twice over.  it does not work. i would not recommend any of dell's pocket dj's. you can have mine for free!  if you know of where i can get a) a new player and b) an online subscription to-go, with a portable device, i'd appreciate your recommendation.  thank you. -rebecca  new york rebeccany30@yahoo.com  
this is a beautiful product. but, if you're like me and have next to no computer savvy, be wary: itunes 7 can be excruciatingly slow. i put in a cd more than a day ago to import to itunes, and it is still not done. i have no idea what to do.  the ipod, which i named lulu, was plugged into my computer for the first time yesterday, and ever since has been sporting the "do not disconnect" screen.  i have found no support phone numbers to call. if/when i figure out how to use this very pretty piece of technology, i may update my review. but as of now, i am hundreds of dollars poorer and have nothing to show for but red-faced frustration.  
researched, bought it, rockboxed it, love it.  great sound, battery life is consistently 14hours which is a lot more than i can say for the i-pods i've had.  
i wanted an mp3 player for working out and running. i am one of those guys who reads everything they can about something before buying one. what i read about mp3 players was a bit worrisome: countless reports that mp3 players break or have minor problems. so i picked up a memorex biomorph (i liked the size and features) along with an extended warranty beyond the 3 month product warranty, and sure enough, with light use, the product died with lots of strange nonsense on the lcd screen after 4 months. (i "reset" the device per technical support troubleshooting, but it didn't help.) i went through the hassle of returning it and getting reimbursed, minus the 40 dollar extended warranty cost. and i set out to read all the reviews i could before buying another mp3 player. i read the most positive reviews and least complaints with the creative muvo series.   my requirements: driverless flash drive [i use it to transfer files between my laptop and desktop, and i want the convenience of being able to plug it into any of my friends' computers, mac or pc, and share files/music], arm band for working out, fm radio, small and light [so a aaa battery model, not aa], and 1 year warranty (this is no longer negotiable). microphone recording a plus, but not a requirement.   the muvo series fit the bill. i wanted a flash memory player, not a small harddrive, because for me it's mainly a workout device, not a home for all my music. i came close to buying the muvo slim, because i loved the idea of a lithium ion battery charging by usb, and i think it looks very cool, but the leather cover has no place for a belt clip, and it lacks an arm band entirely, and so i went for the muvo n200 ("micro").   so far the unit has really impressed me. the memorex came with a bulky, cheap nylon arm strap that was the size of a belt, and even on its smallest setting, was huge. the muvo micro, by contrast, has an excellent arm strap, suitable for a variety of sizes, made from a nice smoky-grey slightly stretchy material. it has a well-sewn extra place to secure the muvo, too, which they could have skipped, since you could attach the muvo anywhere, so it is a nice touch. the memorex used a very cheap thin faux-leather case for the biomorph, while the muvo really surprised me by having a case that is not merely a cover to prevent scratches, but is a thick frost-white rubber sleeve that the muvo slips into. it's pretty cool: clearly if you drop it, and it lands on one of the three corners protected by the sleeve, it will be well protected (it might even bounce). in addition, unlike a vinyl cover, this leaves all of the buttons easily accessible: i.e. it's not like a ski mask with holes for the buttons (this was a pain on the memorex, as the vinyl kept slipping over the buttons). the buttons are well laid out, too. even after four months, i always had to think for a second or two to remember which buttons were for what on the memorex. the muvo makes more sense. for example, the volume up and down buttons are by themselves (not next to other buttons), and they border the lcd screen. the volume up botton is on the side where the bar increases with the volume, and the volume down button is on the side where the bar begins: so it's easy to make second nature. the play/pause button is also by itself somewhere else, so you don't accidentally hit that. overall, a very good layout.   the lcd screen is small, but it's sharp, and you can adjust the brightness, contrast, etc. as others have said, there is an audible buzz on the headphones while the backlight is on, but that lasts about two seconds, and it doesn't bother me.   the menus make a lot of sense. one very nice feature is the ability to make the screen appear upside/down. this way you can choose how you want to wear the player while working out, and then if the screen appears upside down, just flip it. it's those little things that i was happy creative thought of.   another thing: i was quite surprised that the memorex didn't get very loud. i usually had the volume on maximum. the muvo, by contrast, is much louder, so i can have control of the volume back, keeping it around 2/3rds, and then adjusting depending on mood, surrounding noise, etc.   the earbuds which came with the memorex were painful and were garbage, but the creative earbuds are actually pretty good. i did have problems keeping the right earbud in my ear while running, so i'll probably go back to my pair of padded over-the-ear headphones which i prefer. but i was still pleased with the quality of the creative earbuds: e.g. they don't hurt.   the usb 2.0 cable that comes with the muvo is a small-standard usb cable, which means that it's the same cable my digital camera uses, as well as many other devices. this means you can replace it at any store should you lose it and, more practically, it means i can just share the cable i use for the digital camera, thus cutting down on clutter.   i haven't tried some of the advanced features, such as on-the-fly recording of any analog source through the input cable. i also plan on trying some rechargeable batteries.  when i do, i'll revise the review.   one final recommendation: i do recommend you consider the size of an mp3 player before buying one for working out. i saw a picture of a sandisk i was considering, and it looked small, but when i saw it in person, it was huge compared to the micro.   
one of the great things about this player is you do not have to install any special software; just drag a folder of mp3s over to it. the best feature is its future potential; the manufacturer brags 'firmware upgradeable' on the box and an internet search reveals an active user forum and homebrew software available.  i actually found a use for the text file viewer-- it is a handy way to keep track of a new workout routine. sound quality is good enough for loud rock music while mowing or working out.  there are some minor annoyances in the software. the equalizer does not have enough frequency ranges and introduces some noise. there is not a clear indication when you disable the eq and turn on the srs feature. the picture display is cool, but no zoom and pan - even my cell phone does that. however, these are all minor bugs that could be fixed with new software.  one of the advertised features is line in recording - but you don't get the line input jack unless you buy a cradle. hmmm, why not just use the line input jack on your computer sound card and save the money. i would rather have had a line input and/or a mic jack on the unit itself than the wired remote control jack - the iriver is about the size of a remote control itself so i am not sure what the logic was here.  like i mentioned earlier these are minor annoyances and i am generally impressed with the performance and sound on the player.     
please don't buy this product unless you plan on working pro bono as a tech for yourself on behalf of creative. the player will eventually freeze up and attempts to fix officially using creative updated "play for sure" firmware software will "destroy your player for sure". simple. i just wish i had read a little about this before attempting to upgrade the software and i might have salvaged what little was left of the player. the good reviews are simply from people who just haven't heard trouble with their products, it's not a question of if but when. you've been warned.   
i love my ipod and itunes, and simply can not see why people dislike itunes.  a previous reviewer said that they couldn't transfer songs from another computer.  bull.  just right click on the ipod, and change it to manual synchronization.  even if you don't like itunes, there are many other applications, such as ipod agent, that can transfer music (and more) to your ipod that are available online for free.  especially with the new price, ipods rock!  
this has to one of the worst items i ever bougth. it destroyed 4 san disk sd memory cards. i will never buy another memorex product again because of it.   
this product is awesome! i always use this. i didnt expect the video quality on this to be good, but i was wrong, the video quality is surprisingly good. the battery life on this is really good too. i highly reccomend that you buy this because its really a great product and i think that it is well worth the money. it's even a steal!!!  
i was happy with this player in the beginning until i began having problems with some wma and mp3 files.  they just won't play on the device unless i reformat it and copy them back on.  sandisk support always say it's a normal process to reformat a device once in a while.  i don't think so!  well, at least not every 2 weeks...  now my warranty is expired since a week and sandisk completely refuse to exchange it.  they just say "sorry for the inconvenience".  well, i say "sorry, but you lost a customer!"    also, be aware that they only support windows xp under the mtp mode.  i tried putting some files on the device using the msc mode which is compatible with windows 2000.  the device will play the files but when you try to play a complete album, the songs will play them sorted by title instead of track number!  
my son has been downloading music on this since he got it christmas day and he's used up all of his space at about 240 songs.  the amazon ad neglects to mention that it depends on the size of the song that you're downloading.  you'd have to download some awful small songs to reach 500 (or even close to it).  also, he hasn't even put pictures on this thing and still all the room is taken up!!  not happy with this one.  i would recommend the 2 gb zen if you want to get 500 songs on it!  
right out of the box it looks like something from the set of the movie 2001.  pick it up - it feels solid and unbreakable ... though i wouldn't try to drop it on purpose - the 7" screen is not recessed into the case - and covers almost the entire face of the player.  both are features i happen to love about it!  the mp3 player allows you the normal set of music management functions - including sorting and playing by genre, artist, album, year, title ... etc.  however, rather than make you click a button to see the album art - if the image is embedded in the id3 tag, the archos displays it as the song is played. -kewl-  video works well - with almost any codec thrown at it.  pull some free stuff down from the internet - and jump on a plane.  you'll be entertained for hours with the bright clear screen.   screen resolution is just ok to me, though my co-workers really thought the color reproduction was rich and bright.  it could stand for an upgrade in pixels though in the next gen of this device.  in addition, the archos can display photo's one at a time, or you can set it to do a slideshow - and just prop the device back on your desk using the built-in stand - and using it as a photo frame at work :)  i bought the 100 gig version.  there is also an available 40 gig version to be had.  as a technician, this comes in handy.  the device is recognized by any xp computer as an external usb mass storage device - and can be used to carry any type of file - even those it does not natively support for display. - so if you have a need to move a large amount of data from one pc to another - you couldn't ask for a more efficient means ... all with battery power, so no need to plug-in the juice( at least for a few hours before needed to be charged up again )  this archos model also has a usb host port - which allows you to connect other slave usb devices up to it - and copy data to/from them.  such as an external usb disk - or other mp3 player.  just connect it using the included cable - and the archos immediately recognizes it as an external disk ready to manage.  there's more ( scheduler, audio recorder ... ) but i'm running late.  if i can edit this review when i get back, i will - but this covers most of what i've been feeling since i bought the device.  ps - if you're wondering just how big this thing is ... i think it's the perfect size for use as a belt buckle on one of elvis pressley's concert jumpsuits.  ; )  
i have just gotten the white ipod video 60gb for christmas and i am amazed! it is surprisingly easy to put photos and videos on it, contradicting what i have heard so far. but if i were you, i would buy a case that protects the ipod and the delicate screen. i recommend the invisibleshield. here is the link: http://thinkdifferentstore.com/product_info.php/products_id/1431         the graphics and the quality are exceptional for such a small device. but a word of caution, the battery drains faster.  
pro: it has a bigger lcd to play photos. it is slim, and well constructed, and looks great.  cons:  1) for $240 unit, the quality of sound is not impressive.            2) for the unit i own, the battery never runs 30 hours as samsung claims. it only lasts no more than 8 hours without playing any photos.            3) recharging battery is a big headache. first of all, you must connect the unit to a computer with window xp. sometimes, when i try to connect the unit to my computer, it is not able to get through. my computer does not recognize the unit. i have to restart my computer several times before get the unit connected. then it takes 4.5 hours to 5 hours to fully recharge the battery. it is ridiculous for a mp3 running less than 8 hours, and then takes 4-5 hours to fully recharge.

okay, the thing looks great and feels tinier than the previous generation of nano and that's a good thing. there is roughly 7.5gb free space for storage and that's a good thing.  however! buyer beware, because i have found one important negative detail, which is one serious glitch:  approximately 1 in 3 of the mp3 file's i uploaded to the 8gb nano won't play. instead the screen turns black with a white apple logo displayed for approximately 5-6 seconds, then the screen goes off completely for a moment, then reboots to the black screen with the apple logo for a few seconds then displays the main menu. sometimes the root folder of the mp3 file that didn't work is removed from the directory tree.  i haven't found anything online about this glitch--as far as a firmware update or if this problem is widespread. as much as i love it and want to keep it, i will probably be returning this ipod and waiting for a more stable version to be released.  :'(  
"i originally bought a cowan iaudio x5 30gb mp3 from amazon. i wanted to return it, only so i can buy the larger gb60 unit, which i did buy. i liked the iaudio so much, i decided to keep both the 30gb and the 60bg units. i loaded the 30gb with music, and gave it as a gift to my older brother. the reception is excellent. i can hear the bass and the cellos to perfection. it took a little learning for a neophyte to learn how to use it; but after it was loaded with music, i couldn't let go of either unit. it is a great product. i recommend it to all neophyte mp3 buyers" henry j. zeiter, m.d., f.a.c.s. author, "from lebanon to california," at amazon  
i love this thing! had it for over a year now. it pretty much did what i needed it for. totally portable fits in my hand. shaped as a cute bean. the size of the mp3 player was rather convenient for me. i just stuff it in my pocket and there it stays. i also like the built in usb. college student, so whenever i am running low on batteries i could always recharge it at a computer. super fast charge as well, 3 minute charge gave me about 3 hours of music play. fully charged it lasted for days. i listen to this thing everyday usually in 2 weeks i need to recharge it again. i also like the ear buds that came with it. asymmetrical cord allowed me to have the ear buds around my neck instead of putting them away all the time. pretty nice i recommend this to people that are on the go and want something super light.  holds a nice amount of music.    downside is the program that comes with it. converts all the mp3s to an ogg file. its a bit annoying. i use this program only to transfer songs onto the mp3 player other then that i don't use it.   
the player itself has been great.  had to download the new firmware to stop the battery from draining when it went to sleep but after that it was fine.<p>the headset was too small for my big head and the remote control was useless to me because the combined length of the headset cord and the remote (which always popped off anyway) was too long.<p>if you buy a headset make sure it doesn't have the &quot;l&quot; type plug as these don't fit in well to the device.  
but the software sonic stage made this by far the worst mp3 player i have ever owned.  i suggest you try iaudio.  i've had 3 of them (sold one, gave the other one away, and kept one for myself).  easy to upload music, and no headaches like sonicstage.  with iaudio it took me minutes to upload music.  with sonicstage it took me 3 entire days (with the computer running) to upload the 4,000 songs.  pathetic.  
it was good but it wasnt quite built to specs as in the screen fades out every once in a while n stuff  
i have been wanting an mp3 player for 3 years, but due to a lack of a job or cash, i was unable to get one worth its salt. i started working at kroger a few weeks ago(from the time i wrote this), so i finally have an income. thus, the search for an mp3 player began.   i looked at the ipod video, and was set on getting that one for awhile. i mean how cool would it be to carry around videos, music, photos, and anything else you could think of, in one pocket-sized gadget? apple at that point had another willing customer. but then, after more research, i realized just how lame it would be to have to really take care of it, as it does indeed, scratch ultra-easy, and before long, your screen will look like a cat attacked it after a few trips in your pocket. it would get so burdensome, i think, to have to deal with that.  i went to wal mart a couple of weeks back, and my eyes caught a small black mp3 player in the display case...this was the philips gogear 6 gb. i was instantly attracted to its sleek design and just how wicked cool it looked. i also noticed that it was a little over $100 cheaper than the ipod. sure, it didn't have near as much space, or video capability, but it still had a nice variety of features. i'll describe them now:  fm radio: you can listen to the radio on the gogear, and for such a small item, it picks up a nice signal. i have 2 rock-station presets on mine(the only rock stations in my area) that both come in crystal-clear. when tuning for a station, you slide your thumb up or down on the touchpad, and a little indicator shows where you're at, much like an alarm clock or small radio's tuning device.   fm radio recording: i haven't fiddled with this feature yet, but you can record what you are listening to on the radio, and it's quite easy to do so.   protective rubber case: included in the package is a rubber case that does actually protect the player, and has a nice feel to it. you might want to cut a small hole in the center of the top of it, because it blocks the headphone jack. a minor, easily fixable flaw.   earbuds: the included earbuds are a bit new to me, feel-wise, but they look awesome, and sound great! they could compare to the seemingly-perfect sounding white ipod earbuds. these things put out some killer sound.   voice recording: this to me, is a really fun and useful feature. you can record messages to yourself(when you have nothing better to do...lol), record your friends' saying things, or even take them to class and record a lecture. i have roughly 3.5 gigs of space taken up on my gogear, and there is still 3 hours of voice recording available.   pictures: it took me a while to figure out how to get pictures to show up on the gogear. they would transfer with ease, (you must use windows media player, you cannot use windows explorer)but would not be detected in the player itself. also, the picture files must be in jpeg format. my pictures were in that format, but still would not show up in the player. i then came up with this seemingly bogus idea of just transferring my pictures to my documents, to see what that would do. low and behold, it worked! so remember, when you want to transfer pictures, transfer them from my documents, not my pictures. if i'm the only one that had this problem....forgive me, lol.   charging time: somehow, when i plugged it into the wall for the first time(to charge it, obviously), it was already charged! every book and site i've seen about this player says to charge it first, before you do anything, and that when it is charging, there will be a battery charging animation on the screen, and it will stop when it is fully charged. i plugged it in, no animation started, and the battery indicated full! i still have no idea how that happened, but i've been listening to it for 3 hours now, and it has not failed on me. perhaps it really is charged...lol. but initially, it takes 4 hours to charge it fully, or there is a 1 hour(70%) fast charge. for a first time use, a full 4 hour charge is highly recommended, unless you are like me, and get one that is fully charged in the package....i still have no idea how that happened.   i hope this narrative of a review has helped you make your decision, and i say this player is indeed, worth every penny. you won't think twice.   
does the av500 only come in silver? it looks good but if you look at the gmini 500 (it looks the same except in black) it really does look amazing i love the idea that you can record off your tv but i am not sure if you have to buy extra cables for this and i would much apreciate it if someone would tell me thanks guys and have a happy happy easter!!!!!!!!!  
anyone have trouble with your computer recognizing the usb connection with your mp3 player?  i have tried numerous times to get my computer to recognize the creative v100 (has the usb built in, no cord) and the computer simply does not see it.  after looking through creative's web forum, it appears i am not the only one with this problem with this unit.  i've reinstalled the software and even tried plugging the player in without software to see if my pc recognizes it and it doesn't.  i don't have any problems using my usb port when downloading from my digital camera.  i am curious if anyone has had trouble with the sandisk m250 2 gb.  
find something else -- software is not intuitive and requires a lot of manipulation to organize music.  hardware is just as bad -- mine lasted three months before a complete crash.  
the sony bean is junk; the access door is weak and breaks easily. mine broke after using for 2 months, the warranty is 3 months but since this was a christmas present, the warranty had expired. sony offered to do a exchange for the unit at a price that exceed the purchase price by $30. i would never purchase a sony bean again. additionally i am very disappointed is sony's proposed resolution to the issue.  i now have an ipod - it works great   
battery life is great , and the sd card extention is nice you can add a 2gb card no problem.  
i will just mirror everyone else's comments, great player, horrible software.  i wish someone would write better software than sonicstage, it isn't intuitive at all.  even windows media player has a better interface.  if you like your music organized in to neat genres, don't get this player, because sonicstage will make you tear out your hair.  if you just download various music files from p2p sites, then this is for you.  
i've owned two previous rio's that i really liked and were adopted by my kids.  i upgraded to the carbon.  it worked great for one month then required that i format the hard drive every time i wanted to add/delete music.  by month two the "permanent" long life battery was dead.  i followed the exact instructions on rio's website for warranty assistance--three times and was completely ignored.  
this is a nice player, but this one and a black zen v plus 2gb black/green both have a dead screen after three months. i would send them for replacement but when i contact creative about the warranty i got this......   rma fees & details      * according to the data you provided, your creative product is beyond the standard labor warranty but within the 12 month hardware (parts) warranty.     * the diagnostic and handling fee for products returned outside the labor warranty is us$25.00. to continue the on-line rma process, you will need to pay the $25.00 fee using your credit or debit card through our secure shopping cart during this on-line process.    so i have to pay one third of the product price to get it replaced through factory warranty, i don't think so.  
why why why do companies always discontinue their bombproof, proven and reliable products in favor of the latest, greatest and inherantly buggy?  stupid move, creative.  this player is phenomonal.  the zen stone plus - it's presumed replacement - isn't even close.  sigh.   
i was looking for an inexpensive mp3 player for when i go to the gym or beach.  something that if i dropped it in the parking lot i wouldn't be heartbroken or bankrupt over the loss.  this was the player for me.  what they didn't tell you is that the software and windows xp don't play well together.  i tried downloading different drivers and such from their website.  i just made a bigger mess than i had before.  long and short...i had to borrow a friends computer running windows me to get things to work.  once it did, i loved my little gadget.  it was just a long process to get there.  
keeping the kids entertained on long trips has always been a challenge. a close second has been keeping me sane on long flights. a portable dvd player was the best remedy until archos came along. i recently bought one and give it a qualified "mission accomplished," the reservations still being small enough to rate it 5 stars. the thoughtful review by viewer tells you most of the story, but i have my two cents to add.  first, i admire archos for the quality of construction. the unit has a nice sold feel, and is well assembled. face it, if you are parting with 5 franklins, you should expect something solid. they do that nicely.   the av700 has the largest display of any similar unit; it should be the standard for portable players - my two children would fight over who got to hold the ipod to watch a movie, and got myopic staring at postage-stamp sized images. that being said, a brighter display should be built into the device, and off-angle viewing could be better (it is only fair on the av700 - but it is better side-to-side that up-down). if not bright enough for the poolside, it is fine for an airplane or the back seat of the car.  there is a thoughtful range of options. archos has anticipated that one might want to play media on a stereo or tv (like in a hotel room), and has included the necessary cables. software options are equally well worked out, and only took me a few minutes to learn (i am not a rocket scientist). scheduling a recording is pretty easy, and managing a playlist is pretty straightforward, and made easier if you do it from your computer. the browser is really a file management system, necessarily clumsy by the lack of a touch screen or mouse - still much more than tolerable. a cordless remote is a nice thought, anticipating that you might want to navigate the device without getting up from the couch.  the sound quality is good, not surprisingly, comparable to other players. the picture quality is good as well, brightness aside. don't expect a divx to hold up to a dvd if you connect your archos to your 50" plasma tv. that is reallyexpecting too much. that being said, there is some art to ripping and converting movies to divx. all copies are not created equal, and some compromise must be made between file size and image quality. i am a mac guy, and  with a little playing around found a good pathway to convert a file to mpg4 then to divx, with a resulting image that is more than acceptable. the first step will take about 40 minutes, as will the second. if you are smarter than i am, i would bet that you could find a way to do the process in one step. oh, yeah. i forgot to mention that the legality of ripping a commercial dvd is still in question, so i am not recommending that you do it, or admitting that i do it myself. truthfully, though, you still have to rip a dvd of family movies to mp4, and convert the codec to divx before you can watch it on your archos.   as others have pointed out, a usb cable can connect the device to your computer, and whether you use windows or mac, management is much easier. windows guys will find acceptable software built into the machine, but the mac guys will find that osx supports all the necessary functions. by the way, make sure you dismount the av700 before you pull the cable.   most of you who are thinking about buying a unit know that it comes in two sizes. this may be a personal preference, but i recommend buying the 100gb unit over the smaller one - a few extra bucks is worth it, realizing that before you know it you will be pushing the 70gb cieling. finally, i'd give serious thought to buying a spare battery or two. as others have noted, battery life is less than advertised.   when i got my device i was a little disappointed that it didn't play mpg4's straignt, and wished it would play aac (apple ipod) files. that really isn't a complaint, however. of proprietary formats, divx and mpg are pretty much standard, and i can't really blame archos for leaning on them.   all in all, i am very, very happy with my av700. i am almost as addicted to movies as i am to books, so i am glad that archos is feeding my habit. i give this unit 5 stars, realizing that it is 95% of what i wished for in a video ipod.  
-very simple to use.  sound quality is a+.    -earbuds have the best sound for earbuds of those type, but usually too large for most women i find (try creative's ep-360).   -comes with a neck strap, armband or carring case sold seperatly.  -case is hard plastic.  at this time i feel you would have to be very careless to break the battery covering or any part of it.  the battery covering slides in and out with ease.    -my 1st two batteries did last about 18 hours.  easy to use with audible.com and window media player.    -compaired to other players in the same price range, this is the best bang for your buck.  
the toshiba gigabeat 10gb is an excellent value.  it took a while to get used to the navigation system, but i now find it easy to use.  accessories are not as easy to find as for some other brands, but i have managed to acquire the important basics such as a car charger and travel charger. i am overall very satisfied with the purchase and would again choose it over other options.  
software a little confusing, but overall a good mp3 player.  my granddaughter is really enjoying it.  
i got this as a gift for my daughter a couple years back and she still uses it to listen to music.  it navigates through the songs and playlists easily.  if you don't have a ton of music to store and you only need your favorites for walks, workouts, biking, etc, this is a great value for the money.  
i had my creative zen vision for all of about 3 hours.  having previously owned a 20gb creative zen portable media center and being completely unsatisfied with it i was really hoping that creative had gone the extra mile and learned from their past effort.  well, 3 hours into things i discovered they did a few things right but one thing horribly wrong.  the screen quality is just plain awful.  if people are finding a decent angle at which to hold their's then that's great, i couldn't find one at all.  you'll spend more time fidgeting, trying to find an optimum angle than you'll ever spend actually enjoying a movie on the thing.  it's simply a cheap lousy screen.    the rest of the unit is fine.  the construction is solid, the interface very easy to use (though the included software isn't all that great), and even the sound is pretty good - but let's face it, we buy these things to watch movies on and if they can't handle that then what good are they?  
hi,,, im the guy whp wrote the review entitled  kids review. and by the way zip whats an apple salary like. stupid the guy lives in new jersey, i doubt he works for crative. anyways.   i have fallen in love with it lets see sumthing since your ipod man ill show you something9 dont get me wrong i love the ipod 20gb in fact i have one but give me a break its good but its not heavenly  stuff that ipod mini has -calender and such -touch wheel -awesome design - size -large format range -a rich big brother  stuff that creative mini has --calender and such -touch wheel9pad0 -awesome design - size  stuff creative mini has that ipod mini doesnt - fm radio -fm recorder -voice recorder -buttons not on the touch pad+++++++ -cool shiny light on on front peremiter -microsoft outlook autosync( for email adresses and such -better battery life -removable battery -available remote with backlit led screen  thanks for listening   
pros: the t30 makes a great voice recorder.  the mic and line-in sources both produce quality results. both wmp and explorer modes are supported (with firmware change) cons: wmp mode is slow with wmp11 menu navigation takes some time to learn  
i love everything about this little mp3. its my first ipod, so far so good. my only issue is that when i download a live set or dj mixed cd from itunes, when i listen to it in my ipod there are gaps between songs. a little help with this? i'll appreciate it!   
wonderous creative inc fails to notify buyers of the creative zen touch 40gb that all files in your music library get copied to one single root directory on the player (read: no subdirectory functionality whatsoever). the only way to sort your new glorious one directory jukebox is by id3 tags. for those of us who have been using mp3s since the internet was born, we made a habit of deleting id3 tags because they were rarely uniform accross the cddb. sometimes they seemed like they were written by people who could only type with a rubber mallet in one hand and a basketball in the other. or they would classify bach under grunge.  lessons learned: id3 tags are as only as good as their authors, and any kind of naming/classifying standards for music have yet to be developed.  oh yea, and the touch pad pretty much eliminates any kind of in car usage.  
so this is my fifth hard drive mp3 player. i have been using this nice player for over a week now.   sound quality is very good with senn mx500 / shure e3c and so far i see no review complains about it.   transfer file is very simple with drag and drop.  usb host works great with my canon s2 camera.the latest firmware supports ptp camera and all new canon should have ptp but check before you buy it. if your camera is not a massive storage device and doesn't have ptp, a cheap card reader can solve the problem easily.   video playback is super. it can play high resolution video that means you will have less chance of re-encoding your existing videos. even if you are encoding the video for the first time higher resolution equal better tv out quality. you can transfer the video back to the computer or pda anytime for viewing and no worry about the quality.  the lcd is bright and sharp so watching movie on it is enjoyable.   battery life is ok and it's not that bad. in one day, i got 1 hr 30 min music (mp3 192kps)  + 3 hr 40 voice record  (32khz 3 separate files) +45 min video 800kps + 50 min music and my battery had one bar left. yesterday, i went to sleep with my archos on, i woke up in the morning after 6+ hours and wow it was still playing the videos (2x 45 minutes 500kps 320x240 divx.) the battery bar turned red though :)  btw, if you want to play the videos in the same folder automatically, you can set the "playmode" to "folder" and "repeat/shuffle" to "repeat"    great price with tons of features. you can't go wrong with this.  
i love this thing.  it was a great value, love the arm strap so i can run with it when i use my sports head phones.  love the pink.  easy to add music directly from cd w/o storing on computer.  i will consider this brand when i am ready to get a bigger player.  i already filled this one, that is why only 4 stars.    
a good solid player with amazing battery life, sound quality, it's small, lightweight, easy navigation buttons. a joy to use  
worked pretty well for the first month except that there is no way that i could find to bookmark the books i was listening to.  at one month, though, the cheap belt-clip broke off while i was jogging.  so much for "sport digital..."  the clip is just a little tab of cheap plastic coming off the back of the unit, no spring clip like a cell phone would have, and it flexes a little bit every time you put it on or take it off of your belt.  after about 1 month of this, it broke completely off and fell on the ground while i was jogging.  i emailed rca to get them to replace it and they called the belt clip breaking "an act of nature" and said it voided the warranty.  a few weeks after the clip broke, the unit started displaying gibberish instead of the name of the song that was playing and the unit shuts down after about 30 seconds.  rca won't replace the unit due to the so-called "act of nature" so i am out of luck.  the unit was > $100 at the time and rca gives you the finger for buying their crappy product.    bad service + bad product + doesn't stand behind product = don't buy the pos.  
i love to know about new technologies and keep up with them...but it takes me awhile to purchase them...when i decided i needed an mp3 player, i just really didn't need a video or enough space for every piece of music that i ever owned....and i didn't want to spend a fortune. i love my nano plus!  the software is so easy that my kids use it.  i have plenty of room for my favorite music, theirs and even some of dads! i have no idea how or why the ipods are so great, maybe it's hype....who knows...i do not feel like i am missing out on anything.  
i bought this unit when it was so much more pricey.  i used it for  a little while and then the usb connection was broken or without making contact.  i sent the unit in for repairs and it came back fixed but to it was broken again a few weeks after.   worthless piece of equipmment.   
i'm a big techno-geek, but this is been one of the most awkward, horrible experiences i've had trying to get this device to do the simplist things. the application to get your mp3s on this is not user friendly, not intuitive. it's like it's strived to be so different from the ipod that it took out all of the good and left the bad. the player doesn't even register half the time with my computer. it takes a good half hour of messing around with the device and the settings to get it to work. i plug in the ipod and it takes maybe 30 seconds. 1 minute tops.  save your money. save your aggravation. get something, anything else.   
i previously wrote a good review for this mp3 player, which i have since deleted.  basically, what happened was a week after a wrote the review, the thing conked out on me for no apparent reason.  what happened was i had just finished downloading service pack 2 for windows xp (don't know if this caused the problem, but i found it to be an odd coincidence).  i went to erase the songs, which went smoothly, but when i tried to download some different ones, the program froze up on me.  this had happened before, and usually i would just restart the program and it would pick up where it left off.  this time, though, the program would not start.  i tried again and again, to no avail.  well, i figured, i'll give the program a rest.  at least i have about ten songs in the mp3 player.  i'll just listen to those.  well, i went to turn on the player...nothing.  i changed the battery...nothing.    over the course of three weeks, i e-mailed, called and wrote mpio a letter detailing the problem and asking for a refund or replacement.  i heard nothing back, not even an automatic e-mail message.  the only good thing about their customer service is that that don't leave you on hold forever.  after fifteen minutes, they ask you to leave a message detailing the problem.  that's great...if they made the effort to return your call.  well, finally, i gave up, chucked the player and bought a new one (another brand of course).  i talked to several people in the know about this stuff and they said service pack 2 was probably not a factor in the player's demise.  also, my new player works fine, despite my still having service pack 2.  i wouldn't have been so ticked off if the thing hadn't cost 100 dollars and i had it for a whopping nine months.  i expect something at that price to last for a few years, not a few months.  well, i won't ever be buying anything from mpio again, even if they come out with a player that holds a million songs and looks better than the overglorified ipod.  i am extremely disappointed in their product and their non-existent customer service.  i once highly recommend this player, but now i say don't waste your money.  you're 100 dollars is better spent on something else.   
horrible. it is the only word i can use describe every part of philips 9and im not talking about just the product either- the customer service is terrible) sure, it looks nice, and hey- it even works great, until about 6 months, then it will crash on you. and even worse, their customer service does not care about you, they dont even act like they do. i have gone so far as to complain to the bbb and my attorney general because this has happened twice within a span of slightly over a year- and they wont give me a refund and also claim that it is my fault. do not get a philips- otherwise you will have problem after problem with it.   
i found this product to be absolutely terrible.  yes, it does eliminate buying a cd writer in some respects, however, the lack of time available is unfortunate.  it's not worth the money.  mp3's are absolutely amazing,  although the technology is not refined enough to hit hand held,  take my  advice go with a cd writer and you can copy much more than an audio median.  
while i'm a big fan of lexar's flash memory cards, this mp3 player is a very poor choice, even though its memory can be expanded via a larger-capacity sd card.  first of all, this player is thick.  companies like creative labs have thin and stylish mp3 players, but this lexar is thick and unstylish -- you have to see it in person to see what i mean.  it's not really butt-ugly like iriver players, but still very plain.  again, it's the thickness that unpleasantly surprised me.  second, sound quality is terrible.  the same mp3 files (encoded at 192kbps) that sound great on the ipod sound muffled and colorless on this lexar.  worse, there are occasional pop noises that are not present on the ipod or archos av320.  this is just terrible.  for this alone, i advise you stay away from this lexar product.  third, the buttons are hard to use (esp. when the player is in the cheap clear plastic case) and the screen is hard to see in most lighting situations.  this is simply one of the most user-unfriendly mp3 players i've come across.  fourth, yes it has built-in fm, but its reception is horrible.  my tiny $5 no-name am/fm radio gets clear reception here in the office, but the lexar gets nothing but statics.  i don't think this is because i got a lemon; from what i've read elsewhere, this is a common complaint.  in short, while i'll continue to buy lexar flash memory, i'll advise anyone not to even think about getting this mp3 player from them.  in fact, if you search on amazon you'll see their other mp3 players are no good, either.  
the price is not right, when a toshiba lap top, with 40gb, wifi goes for 600 dollars paying just 100 less for a mere 4 gb is absurd.   
my husband bought this mp3 player for me as a birthday present. it's a whopping 5 gb player and you'd have to put down at least $250 if you want an ipod with comparable storage. it holds an amazing number of songs and i especially like the recorder feature. it's great for undergraduate and graduate students because you can record lectures and listen to music with one little device! both the device and the software are straightforward and easy to use. i agree with the other reviewer because it is a tiny bit annoying that you can only create playlists when you're hooked up to the software, but it's really a minor flaw and definitely not a big enough problem that i wouldn't recommend it to others. even if i hadn't been biased against ipods before this because of their ridiculous marketing strategies ("buy our products because they look cute and come in flashy colors! never mind if they're quality products or reasonably priced!"), i still would have thought this product was 10x more efficient and reasonable.  my only complaint is that mine broke easily. i see that others reviewers have dropped it multiple times with no problems, so i guess i got the token dud. i only had it for a few months and i dropped it once at the grocery store, and now it's broken and unresponsive to anything i do.  here's my personal plea: it looks brand new on the outside and i hate to buy a new mp3 player for $100 when i know there's someone/someplace out there that can fix it. i checked rio's website and they no longer fix their players, so does anyone know of other companies with websites that i can check with? if not, do you have any general suggestions as to where i could start? any type of stores or business that might offer this service? thanks and i'd appreciate any help!  
i bought one of these for my 9 y.o. daughter last christmas.  she loves it!  it's small enough to fit into her pocket and has a little hook on top for charms or a lanyard strap.  the mp3 is easy enough for her to use by herself when downloading her favorite music and family photos.  i would recommend this to anyone with younger kids.  the battery last a long, long time between charges via usb on any computer.  don't buy the super expensive mp3s, this one packs a punch for much less--- holds tons of media files, plays fm radio, and records. the graphics on the screen are cool too.   
as a senior citizen i may be the oldest person to have purchased this ipod. i love it for walking and listen to workout and dance music as i walk. it's easy to download the music from my imac. and its so easy to use. all i can say is "cool"    
i got mine alittle over a week ago directly from apple.  (sorry amazon, but it's the same price, + free laser engraving & shipping)  i had bought the ipod 60gb photo for about a week, but as soon as i saw these new ones coming out, i sold the photo on ebay and bought the 60gb video in black.  i got the new one for 3 main reasons:  1: the ipod is finally in black!  2: it's thinner = more portability.  3: yes, it plays video.  now these reasons are listed in order.  i didn't get this new one just for the video.  i got it as a music player first and a video player second (or third).         first off, since it's the new feature, lets talk about the video.  the video quality is excellent!  (considering that the screen is only 320x240 pixel)  i say this from putting my own videos on it, meaning videos that weren't downloaded from itunes.  $1.99 isn't too bad a price for a music video or an episode of a tv series, but at the same time, most of the music videos and tv series episodes they offer aren't everybodies can of beer!  (i don't care for lost and especially desperate housewives...unless the 4 women did the show nude!)  all i did was rip the dvd of a tv series or whatever i want, then transcode it into a format that the ipod can read, and presto!  now i know while your reading this your thinking, "if i get this ipod, how can i put my favorite stuff on it the way this guy is talking about?"  no problem, i'll tell you!         first, if you want to get a movie or a tv show off a dvd, chances are it's probably css encrypted.  (pretty much any movie or tv series dvd you buy at any store)  to rip these type of dvd's into a video file, you'll have to get a dvd ripping program that can decrypt css.  you can find a number of them online for free or cost alittle $ to download.  my experience, most of the freeware ones can't rip any decent quality video, so you'll probably have to shell out afew bucks to get a decent one.  i had already downloaded one called aoa dvd ripper afew months ago for about $25 or $30.  (do a google or yahoo search to find the site)  it does a really good job of ripping the dvd's and the video/audio quality is great.  (especially using the divx 6 codec)  next, you'll need to transcode the video file into a format the ipod can read.  (go to apple's website for video specifications)  i already had quicktime 7 pro, which comes with a setting to save videos it can open to the proper format.  i tried using it; it took an hour just to convert 5% of the video!  it was only a 22 minute video!  way too long a conversion time!  (would have taken almost a day!)  so i went searching online for another program that would do this faster.  i found a freeware program called videora ipod converter.  (again, do a yahoo search to find the download site)  it comes with a number of options and it does a great (and fast) job of converting the video to the right format.  tip: when using this program, only certain video settings can be used for the converted video to work on the ipod.  check the forum of the website you download this program from to see what other settings people have tried to get it working.  it may seem like a lot of trouble, but if you want to be able to watch certain videos, it isn't that bad once you get everything set up.  (it only took me a total of 30 minutes to put an episode of chappelle show on my ipod using the process i described above!)      now that the video is out of the way...the sound of the ipod is excellent.  i read somewhere that they also fixed 3 minor sound bugs that were present in the earlier versions of ipod.  (another bonus)  overall, there isn't too much more new about the new ipod besides what i talked about.  one drawback that people have mentioned, but hasn't affected me; the 4 prong connection that was on top next to the headphone jack is gone.  so if you already have ipod accessories that use them, tough luck, they won't work on the new one.  they'll be coming out with accessories to replace the older ones sometime though that exclusively use the dock connector on the bottom.  (already have in some cases)  also, if you don't like using itunes to transfer music to your ipod, there's a program out there called anapod made by red chair software.  it integrates into windows explorer and just drag and drop!  has a lot of cool/handy features, and they just put a new version out that supports the new ipod!  (namely transferring video)  it costs about $25 -$30 depending on which version you get.  well worth it though, i think.  hope this review helped you out!          
i used to use a bulky mp3 cd player on my jogs.  after researching mp3 players and what i wanted to use them for, i decided on the zen nano plus.  apple's equivilent would be the shuffle, not the ipod nano as many misunderstand.  here's why this player beats the shuffle in so many ways: -price -fm radio + radio recording! -built in mic and line-in recording to mp3!  (96,128,192kbps selectable rates) -a display -a backlit display -preset & customizable eq -removable battery (aaa) -does shuffle come with belt clip/arm band? (really, i don't know) -mass storage device when plugged into usb. -ms plays for sure -using wmp 10 and sync, it auto-creates artist/album folders on the device. -about half the size of a pack of big red gum (it is really small)   shuffle pros: itunes (which i love, but wmp is catching up).  
i purchased one of these refurbished rio players as an introduction to protable mp3 - i loved this thing for the first ccouple of months - great sound, ample storage, nice interface.  then it started to fall apart - first the volume dial got stuck, then the buttons stopped responding.  the 'push and turn' style of the volume knob is a very poor design that doesn't work and is prone to breakage. don't be inticed by the low price and ample storage - this thing won't last more than a few months, and there are lots of better options out there now as every consumer electronics manufacturer has jumped into this market.   
unfortunately, i found the nexus to be a very niche product. i'm sure anyone who is researching this product knows by now that it does not allow you to listen to live xm content on the go. fair enough, since it never claimed to. however, the idea of this being such a small player only for use of mp3 content and recorded xm content did not impress me.  the screen is incredibly small. of course, this isn't a problem if you are using this player hand held, or in a situation where you don't want to see the display anyway. however, listening to live xm content is entirely different. don't expect to have this receiver docked in the home kit a yard away from you, and still have the ability to read the screen.   this also becomes a problem in the car. i drive a small compact two-door car, and had the receiver mounted at eye level on the dash. i could see the display okay. not perfect, but okay. my passengers, however, could not see the display at all. before you have the chance to think of any bad eyesight jokes, i have had both an xm roady 2 receiver and a sirius audiovox pnp3 receiver mounted in this same position, and never got any complaints. adjusting the brightness and contrast didn't do much good. the artist text is easier to see than the title text, as it is in bold letters. having a black and white screen did not help.  to record live xm content, you must begin the recording within 45 seconds of the start in order to get the entire selection. this may be great when you hear the first notes of a song you know, love, and want to record, but it's a huge flaw for discovering new music. how many of us can decide within the first 45 seconds of a song whether it is or isn't a song we'll want to hear again? since xm boasts of having the largest play lists on satellite radio, how can you assume that song you just heard on deep tracks will be a song you will ever hear again on xm?  wait, you could've just add it to your tuneselect, so it will notify you next time it is played and you can record it then, right? nope. the nexus does not include a tuneselect. nor does it even include a memory option, where you can store the artist and song title. there is an option titled "bookmark" though, where the nexus and the included napster software will make it easier for you to find and purchase any song you "bookmark" when you have the nexus connected to your pc. however, i could find no way to see what songs i bookmarked without using the included napster software.  the user interface on the nexus could use a lot of help. there are way too many buttons to press to find your way around the unit. simply going from live xm to recorded/mp3 content can take a while. be prepared to wander around aimlessly with this receiver for at least the first few hours.  of course, this receiver does not have the 1-10 presets that other satellite radio receivers do. i did find switching between stations more challenging while driving due to this. you can set up a "favorites" category list on the nexus, but i would have liked more options for customization with this category.   both the nexus home kit (included with the receiver) and the car kit come with remotes. i found the remotes to be pointless though. the remotes could have offered an easier way of getting to your favorite channels, but there was no such option. the number keys on the remote only guided you in accessing a channel if you knew the channel number. if you could dock your nexus across the room and see the display clear enough, the remotes may have been of more use.  as for mp3s, you are able to search by artist or song title, but not album. you just transfered the entire led zeppelin ii album onto your nexus, and you want to play it from start to finish? well, if you have some other led zeppelin songs on your nexus, you'll have to find "whole lotta love" and begin playing there. the album title will not be displayed on the nexus screen though, and the track number won't be either. i'm not expecting the nexus to be an ipod, but i did find this to be an extreme annoyance.   note that the nexus can be partitioned to store either 50% xm content and 50% personal content, or 100% xm content. don't expect to fill 1gb of your own mp3 collection.  the nexus also contains a new technology for xm known as the passport. the passport is a small chip that is docked directly behind the nexus in the home or car kit. it is not and cannot be physically connected to the nexus. the passport is only required for live xm content. if you purchase a nexus and activate it with xm, you are not actually activating the nexus. you are activating the xm passport. essentially, you can purchase as many passport enabled receivers as you desire and only pay one subscription fee, assuming you will only want to listen to live xm content on one receiver at a time. of course, this is a plus side to the passport technology. if you only have the desire to own one nexus, it can be a real pain to have to carry around and dock both the nexus and the passport with you every time you go from the car to home. the passport's small size could make it much easier to be lost or misplaced as well.  i have heard that satellite radio companies make it hard for thieves to get away with stealing equipment. the victim of the theft just needs to contact the company, and they will blacklist the id of the receiver so it cannot be reactivated. the passport makes the nexus an easier target, since it is impossible for the receiver to be blacklisted, due to the id coming from the passport.   although i am well aware that the car kit is sold separately, i feel the need to mention in this review that i was not comfortable with the cosmetics of the car dock. the bright silver color of it made it very easy to see, regardless of the time of the day or the amount of light coming into my car. needless to say, i was concerned that this would be a huge theft magnet. most satellite radio receivers and mp3 player car docks are much more low profile, and for good reason.  although i'm sure this is the result of stricter fcc guidelines, fm modulation is only an option with the car kit. unlike previous satellite radio receivers i have owned, you can use any fm frequency you desire with the nexus. one thing to note is that the fm modulation will not work if you have anything plugged into the "line out" of the car kit, such as a cassette adapter or auxiliary cables. i was very disappointed that no fm modulator is included with the home kit.  i can't say there is nothing positive about the nexus though...  loading your personal music collection onto the nexus is very simple. you can even simply do a copy/paste or drag and drop though windows. i used rhapsody instead of napster to load some of my songs onto the nexus, and it worked perfectly.   i also liked that there was an equalizer included. of course this is an expected feature of an mp3 player, but it also works with live xm content.   it doesn't play only mp3s either. i have all of my music library encoded with itunes aac, with a vbr of 128kbps. i had no problems with playback of these files.  overall, the nexus does what it is advertised to do. i feel the receiver comes short on many features and with it's portability. i noticed the price of these have already gone down substantially since the holidays, and some retailers have already stopped carrying them. it should be interesting to see if samsung and xm continuing with this design. hopefully they will address some issues and create a receiver worth while.   
i received a nomad jukebox zen xtra for christmas last year.  it worked fine for six months and then the headphone jack malfunctioned.  it was out of warranty, but it certainly wasn't time to pitch it a get a new one.  i returned it to creative to have the jack replaced.  this cost $20 for an initial evaluation.  after a couple of week creative called me and said that the unit would have to be replaced with a refurbished unit at a cost of $200.  new units can be purchased for $239.  i thought this was stupid since the harddrive is completely detachable from the rest of the unit (surely half the cost).  it made me wonder if they can't fix a bad headphone jack, what on earth could they fix.  seems like they scammed me for $20 in addition to their bad product.  since the unit was completely functional except for the headphone jack, i chose to have the unit returned without repair and use it as a portable harddrive.  i had also hoped that i could listen to the music through my computer.  it wouldn't be completely portable, but i could take it to work.    i then made two painful discoveries.  first, the headphone jack on the jukebox is the only audio output, even though you can control the unit from your computer using creative's software and the software appears to have functionality to change the output.  secondly, there is no way to access the jukebox as a generic mass storage device, so you can use another media program.  consequently, i have to drag files over to my computer harddrive to listen to them.   the jukebox will also not let you copy protected files to a computer.  pretty short sighted when you consider that there is no way to backup your protected files.  jukeboxes are great and i will buy another one.  it won't be a creative product.    
great item.  it's and ipod what else need you say?  my wife loves it.  
i returned this item right after i bought it.  i own two ipods already and wanted to buy another mp3 player for the kids.  i figured i'd try another product and the price was right, but you get what you pay for.  i followed the instructions, connected the player, the device was recognized by my computer only intermittently.  the device also froze up and had to be reset.  the software would freeze up when running and crash as well.  i went to creative's website, tried their troubleshooting help to no avail.  after a couple of frustrating hours, i've given up.  too much effort.  i'm buying the new nano....  
i've had this mp3 player for about 2 years now and it's been pretty good. well it was for about a year anyway. after that the buttons pretty much stopped working. at first, it was just one and then gradually they all stopped working. it really sucks because this is a good mp3 player and it holds all my music but now i cant use it because the buttons dont work. besides the buttons not working, it also doesnt hold a charge for very long. it lasts for about 4 hours until it dies. if you want a mp3 player that lasts long and is durable then you should probably keep looking because this definitly doesnt. but it was good while it lasted =/   
this is my second mp3 player and i love it. before buying this one i had a creative micro zen, which was amazing, but worked for only a month, then the headphone jack brake and since i didn't have the guarantee (in fact i bought it in canada and i live in chile) i just sold it by pieces. then i made an extensive research and i realized that-of the people i know-the ones with sony mp3 players were the happiest, in fact they were more satisfied than the people who owned ipods. so i bought this player.  the first thing i liked about it is the small size and weight (useful). putting music on it it's easy too, eventhough transforming 100 mp3 songs into atrac3plus took me like 2 hours o__o. anyways...the sound it's nice too, i have some big noise-cancelling phillip headphones and the player works really nice with them. oh, and a aaa battery last a lot(i bought the player on xmas and i haven't change the battery since then...).  so if you're looking for a cheap player, try this one, it's the best choice =)  
this is my first mp3 so i am new to the game.it sounds grate after you mess with the eq.the headphones they give you suck but after geting my sony ear buds(walfart$10)i realy like the thing.it was a little tricky at first to figer out how to down load my music.the player uses a drag and drop process.it may be me or windows but it would not sinck my playlist from windows sinck list.every time i tried it would put songs from the same album in thier own folder.it only holds 30 folders.so if you have just a few songs from each album and more than 30 songs you have a problem.but once i figerd out what was going on it was all good.thier software works good becuase it keeps all the songs as singls and you can make play lists with it.and with a simple click,drage,drop you have your music.i gave it a 4 becuase of the lack of instructions in the manaul.it just tells you how to turn the darn thing on and scroll thru folders.i do wish it was a 2gb player.but for my first mp3 it will do until i get the 30gb m-vision.   
ok, i'm going to start off with the good things first...excellent amount of space for the price...radio on it...etc. bad things...it stops working like 4 months into using it. yeah, so this is my second mp3 player this year...i'm actually thinking about getting a good ole' fashion disk player to save myself the money.   simply put, you get what you pay for.   
after about a week of researching about 25 mp3 players i finally settled on the rca kazoo. i wanted the smallest mp3 player possible, but didnt want to sacrifice great sound. my kazoo delivers for only $... after much research i decided i needed a unit that had: lock (so buttons dont get pushed accidentally), bass boost/ equalizer, digital volume control, big clear display, & fast transfer rate (2.4mb/sec). you'd be supprised many more expensive units dont have all of these features. i also didnt care about other formats since mp3 is the standard & all formats can be converted to mp3 via software. the included software music match & real jukebox are excellent. i just dragged & dropped my mp3 files from explorer into real jukebox. real jukebox lets you set the bit rate you would like and automatically lowers bitrate on files to bitrate you choose to save memory/size. this brigs me to the 1 of 2 drawbacks. although 32 mb is common w/ mp3 players it isnt enough (at 128k bit rate). i plan on ordering a 64 mb mm card (dont pay more than $1/mb if you decide to buy memory). i did find out that at 56k the sound was still awesome & i can hold about 75 minutes of music w/o extra memory. the second drawback doesnt apply to me but i read in one review that this doesnt support mac. if you are a windows user you will be very satisfied!! i can't see why anyone could buy a player w/ a slower transfer rate; usb is the way to go. <br>one last note: the display is large & easy to read. it shows track, time, bit rate, volume, battery, & dsp.  it does not show the name of the current song that is playing the way larger mp3 players do.<br>hope this helps & good luck in your search.  
i purchased this product for my husband's birthday.  unfortunately, he only had it 2 days before an accident occurred in which the belt clip slipped from his belt and the player fell about 2 feet to our tile floor.  this 1 fall seems to have wrecked the player.  i might have done better to purchase a $300 brick.  i am currently researching methods of somehow rescuing the player without paying the exhorbitant repair fees charged by creative (since the warranty doesn't cover anything that isn't creative's "fault"--as if poor durability isn't their fault).  i have heard that the i-pod can sustain several falls without severe problems, and if i had known of the zen's poor durability before my purchase, i would have bought the i-pod instead.  so: head's up if you're considering this purchase.  
do not buy this product! i bought a zune for my husband because all of our music files are in .wma format, which is a microsoft format. i have downloaded all of my music legally over the years in a .wma format.  the only reason i bought the zune was so that my microsoft-formatted songs would be easily loaded onto the microsoft zune.  imagine my surprise and distress when i discovered, after purchasing the zune and attempting to load my legally purchased music, that it will not play any songs downloaded from any site other than the zune marketplace! in fact, when i called the zune support line for support, they graciously offered to sell me all the songs that i have already legally downloaded and purchased from other sources! isn't that generous of them?  save yourself heartache and frustration and do not buy a zune!  
bought this for the wife at christmas, loaded up around 1k songs quick enough, but some songs would suddenly just not play, eventually you wouldnt be able to play any and i would have to "recover" the drive (i.e. wipe it and re-sync the music). this happens like every week now.  have emailed to iriver 3 times now over 10 day period. no reply. they provide no telephone number that i can find.  going to try and return it to amazon now, at least they give good customer service.  it may well be that i just have a bad drive, but iriver dont seem to care about it.  
i finally got mine today and within 2 hours of playing around with it, the screen and front bezel already show many scratches!  my mini never scratched and my 3rd gen 20 gig didnt show scratches like these until after months of playing. there is obviously a problem with the coating that is applied to both the lcd and front bezel. i can only imagine how bad it will look in a couple of weeks :( beware and stay away from the ipods until apple gets there stuff together and fixes this problem!   
first, let me start with the things i really do like about the gb30. the user's interface is simple, the graphics are crisp, and it is ridiculously intuitive to manage and transfer music as a napster ready-to-go device.  however, the battery performance is pitiful. after 10 days (painfully aware that i am outside the window to return this for a refund from my seller), the battery would drain despite the fact that the unit was turned off.  after reluctantly returning the unit to the toshiba repair depot, i received it within another 7 days only to find that they did not fix the problem.  so, i give up. i keep the unit fully charged by keeping it plugged in to the wall outlet between uses.  however, i will never by another toshiba product nor would i ever recommend this seller again.  
i actually went from a dell jukebox 20gb to this thing. gotta say, it was pretty weak. i loaded it up full from the 2nd day on and maybe this was the problem but i'm not sure why it glitched out on me all the time.  i had to buy a 1gb player as a backup to my commute!  in any case, you can't edit songs on the player itself, playlists are annoying to edit - but i did love the playlist on the fly function - and the software is like the commodore 64.  brutal.  i had this thing less than 6 mos and sold it for cheap.  never buy this.  never.  
while i enjoyed this little light weight gizmo while it lasted, it didn't last very long.  within the span of a month it was pushing up daisies, not playing, not responding, not acessable through any computer (pc or mac.)  i used it mostly during my mile walks to and from work and trips to the grocery store, neither could be considered extream environments.  
bought the zen nano plus for my 13 year old son. i am pleased to say it was an excellent choice, as it's very easy to load with music and to use the controls. the sound quality rivals the best of players. and most of all my son loves it. some of his friends who have ipods even envy his player! bravo to creative for bringing us a great product at an affordable price!  
i love this thing.  its so lightweight and perfectly designed for running with, unlike most other mp3 players.  some tips for others to note with this device, and some for all such devices: although mp3 is the most widely used format, wma offers the same qualty for less space thus giving you more music.  also, and this is important to know for this device, the sandisk cards are the only ones guaranteed to work all the time with the nike players, the other brands have been found(by the sonicblue development team) to work only part of the time.  make sure you get a sandisk card so you dont end up getting burned and then taking it out on the good folks who made this wonderful device.  
this is a nice product. the only problem is that when charged through your computer it takes forever to fully charge. additionally, if you utilize the equalizer function, the battery runs down exceptionally quick. despite those functions, the overall product has great features and a great sound!  
i bought this based on reviews here and elsewhere.  i can justify the cost because the unit accepts an external micorphone-- something i need since i do a lot of interviewing.  the voice recording quality is excellent.  not quite as good as my sony md recorder but then i don't have to up load my files in real time.  but for music... this is a very weak player.  i tested with four different kinds of head phones including the supplied ear buds.  no matter how i adjusted the sound controls the tone is either flat or excessively tinny to the point that it hurts.  for $195 with tax this is probably going to go back to the store.  i'll try the iriver next.    
in all fairness this player was defective. i did like the features and the size of this player, when it did work. however, the support is not good at all.  there is no 800 number to call and all questions are answered by email.  the process takes 24 hrs.  if you don't receive a positive answer, you need to wait for another response, another 24 hrs.  this is irritating.  this player has a long way to go, but when the bugs are satifactorily corrected it will probably be very popular.   creative produces a very good sound blaster.  amazon,s return policy is terrific.    
very compact size/weight is great for clipping onto workout wear. easy to use..great sound..great little screen..good battery... love it !  
wow. what a difference a generation of mp3 players can make. absolutely impressed with this model.  this thing has everything you could possibly think of, and more.  especially like the progressive scanning. very helpful when listening to long audio tracks.  
in concurrence with the previous opinion given by the reviewer from tuscon, i'd also have to assert that a great deal of the negative reports on the samsung's quality are products of poor use or sheer dissemblance to the ipod. make no mistake: the samsung could still use a bit of improvement in the ease-of-use (mostly with the device itself rather than its music transfer capabilities) and compatablity departments, but it blows ipod out of the water so far as versatility, display quality, and overall attractiveness are concerned.   in terms of display, the samsung offers a sizeable display along with brilliant color to more-than-accomodate it. however, whether one would find the color display of the samsung or the color display of the new fourth-generation ipods is - i'd have to say - largely a matter of personal taste (as i own both devices): on the one hand, while the samsung indeed offers a colorful and playful display, the ipod's new display - while less flashy - is...well, less flashy. in other words, if attractive simplicity is what you'd prefer, then perhaps the ipod is your ticket, but the samsung still offers more than simply its impressive artwork, or even the per se attractiveness of the actual device.  the photo album/slideshow feature is also innovative and equally attractive, and uploading them in a cinch. in fact, uploading in general - contrary to some reports - is a cinch, though the same can't really be said for managing the device in other respects. the playlists can be somewhat intransigent at times in terms of their organisation.   of course, one of the greatest stigma for those who find themselves considering whether it is safe to jump off the ipod bandwagon to switch to a pc-grounded or alternative player is the issue of not being able to take advantage of the myriad of accesories that now exist in the market for the ipod and don't yet exist on such a scale for even the most popular of alternative devices. now if you're looking for an mp3 player that will serve more as portable stereo of sorts or a room-studio hub, then, again, perhaps the ipod is indeed your ticket. but if you're looking for an mp3 player that serves its purpose best as...an mp3 player, than you've found a superior one in the samsung yh-925.  
i have owned an ipod for a little over a month now and still have not gotten it to synch with my pc.  i put my faith in the apple myth that everything always works.  the amount of time and money i've put into trying to get it to work i could have put my money elsewhere.  bottom line: unless you have the time and money to try and make your ipod work, go elsewhere!!!!  
this computer is one of the worst items i've ever had (i took it back in the first week of using it)  it has a horrible screen  aim doesnt work at all  internet browser is soooooooooooooo slow  don't buy it!  
this mp3 player is awesome. i have nothing bad to say about it. the software is extremely easy to use. the only problem i have is trying to navigate the menu in the car (which i shouldn't be doing anyway) and really isn't the players fault i guess. one other thing is it only has a 3 bar battery monitor so when one bar is left you could have 10 mins or up to 8 hrs. other than that though it is perfect. after using my brother's ipod for a month prior to getting this, the micro is preferable in many ways (most important to me is ease of use and it is considerably smaller).   
i just got this cool little device two days ago and can't say anything but good things about it. i'm always skeptical about reviews, and this one had nothing but good ones. it has been mentioned the screen is small, which was my concern, but it turned out bigger than i pictured and very good looking. this plays ripped dvds/tvshows flawlessly and the audio is fantasic. if you are considering buying thisd over your standard mp3 player or the apple movie player i would highly recommend the gmini 402.  
this mp3 player rocks! and here's why: 1. it sounds great 2. it's the size of a book of matches and weighs like one ounce 3. it has a color screen 4. has rechargeable battery 5. is simple to use and navigate once you are familiar with it 6. no moving parts, it's a flash drive 7. no extra software required, just drag & drop in windows, or media player. 8. it has a fm radio built in. the only downside to this player is the crappy headphones included. i bought some better headphones, and with the included belt clip, i'm all set for the gym. ipod shuffle eat your heart out.  
i already had a sony minidisk player.......but the zen is ligher and comes with the advantage of the box and armband......awesome sound quality and the fm tuner is sweet....whenever you get tired of the mp3s you can switch to a station and listen something unexpected!.....helps me keep my mp3 collection updated by introducing new songs!......also, you can use it as a portable harddisk....for those last minute files while you are leaving the office!.......for a small gadget, it packs quite a punch! my only criticism, the controls are packed with too much functions.....oh well, i can live with that....nice toy!   
i bought it for my dad and i haven't heard any complaints. so i guess everything is working ok. but those head phones are huge!!   
being an ex-ipod owner, this item definitely is better than the hype of apple products makes ipod's out to be. i am very pleased with my creative. i'm amazed with how much more the user can do on the player itself, unlike the ipod where functions and settings were barely customizable from the player. love the radio and microphone features which ipod also lacks. i use these features quite a bit! i've convinced several friends to buy this product because i've been so pleased. and besides all these features, 8 gb is the perfect amount of space for most "normal" people... and can be purchased for the same price as an apple nano 4 gb, which i must say is too small anyway. this player fits right into my hand. the volume is also great in the headphones. if a friend is listening with me, i no longer (like w/my ipod) have to turn the volume all the way up and ruin my headphones to have lound enough music. works great in the car with my iriver fm transmitter. couldn't be happier with this item! thank you creative labs. way to go with this product.   
i bought one of these to replace my broken dynex dock remote, and it worked fine for abot a month.. and then broke, too. the bottom connector was just sheared away and pushed up inside the unit, and was rattling around. i could still use the remote, but i couldn't charge it while doing so, which was the entire reason that i bought a remote with a pass-through port. so, i figured it wasn't a problem, i'd just send it back and get a replacement. first, i discovered that the company had no written return policy anywhere (not inside the box, not on their website) and so i had to send an angry e-mail to find out what the policy was. they told me to ship it back with a copy of the invioce, and they'd replace it for me. that was six weeks ago. one week ago, i sent an e-mail (a nice one this time) asking what was up... no response came back.  in short: company is untrustworthy and makes products of questionable quality. do not buy.   edit: sent a series of nasty e-mails last week off to the company, and finally got ahold of some gushing apologetic rep who said that a replacement was in the mail and i would get a tracking number by the end of the day. that was four days ago, and i (of course) have recieved no further e-mail. i also recently learned that this company, in addition to ipod remotes, makes devices which hack into entry-coded security locks and gates. just in case you had any doubts about their trustworthiness.  edit #2 it has now been three months. i think it's fairly safe to say the company intentionally ripped me off. after all, what am i going to do? sue them for $23?  
i bought this player and was fairly happy with it.  it is very small and sounds fine.  unfortuneately, i lost the cd containing the drivers for it.  i called customer service to get a replacement cd.  my first call to rca/thompson technical support directed me to a page where i could download software for the rca lyra.  after telling the representative that i had the k@zoo, and not the lyra, he said &quot;sorry, that's all the information i have.&quot;  <p>today, i figured i'd try again - maybe there'd be more information.  this time i was told, in fact, that the software is not available online, but that the cd could be shipped to me.  however, it would cost $12.95 for a cd containing one driver, and 2 free to download software programs.  i was about to order, when i was then informed of the $9.95 shipping fee.  to mail me one compact disk.  <p>needless to say, i am far from pleased, and i urge anyone considering buying an rca product to stay far, far away.  if you ever need customer service (and judging by the reviews of many mp3 players, you will), you will greatly regret the purchase.  
i went to bestbuy to get an ipod but ended up buying "philips hdd6330 30 gb mp3 player". i am impressed by its performance. i was little skeptical while buying, as this being a new product from philips. i got the 2 warranty which costed me another $30 and i am glad i got the warranty after looking at the reviews here. but quite frankly i didnt hv any problems till now. the product looks great!! its nice that they hv a inbuilt voice recorder which records pretty well. i would recommand this for the price. the only drawback is, it doesn't have that many accessories as an ipod.  
i am addicted to audio books (in mp3 format) so i've got to have an mp3 player.  i have been using this little gem for about half a year now and i'm more than happy with it. i had been using a samsung yepp yp-f1x 512 mb mp3 player (which i was also happy with), but i lost it. i decided i needed more memory than my old unit so the creative zen nano plus was my choice.  what i love about it (in no particular order): ~ the track will start off where it was stopped. awesome feature for audio books. ~ size. fits in any pocket. ~ storage. 1 gb is enough to hold two or three books, depending on the size of the books. ~ can be used as a flash drive. ~ the scrolling. fast-forwarding and rewinding gets incrementally faster the longer the scroller is pressed. this is a great feature for audio books. ~ the "lock" function. when a track is playing, the mp3 player can be locked so that when buttons on the player are pressed the track is not interrupted. this is a great feature for audio books.  why it's *almost* perfect: ~ i miss the clip on my old mp3 player that allowed me to attach the player to my clothing. if i don't have any pockets i put the zen nano in a cell phone holder that has a clip, but that adds bulk and looks stupid. ~ i seem to go through a lot of batteries. i have been keeping track and, on the average, i replace the battery about every four weeks. i wish it could charge via the usb cable like my previous unit.  the worst thing about it: ~ when the battery is almost drained, the player sometimes loses the ability to scroll and will sometimes not start the track where it was stopped. this means i end up putting in a new battery even though there is still a little bit of juice in the old battery.   i would buy this mp3 player again if i needed another one. in fact, i am going to get one for my brother for christmas this year. and some batteries.  
i've owned creative zen and ipods, but nothing can touch this thing. if you have nice home or car stereo equipment, this is the player to have.  first, it plays cd quality (flac) lossless files, so instead of compressing your music to the sorry mp3 format at an average of 192 kbps you can listen to music as it was intended to at 1411 kbps.  many will say there is no difference, but plug this thing into your home receiver or car stereo and you can definitely hear it.  second, (and very important to me), you can bypass the itunes or any other memory resident programs designed to "help" load your music into your player - just plug the cowon into your computer's usb port and it becomes an additional drive.  you can then drag and drop your files - it's that simple.  it is well build, with a solid feel to it.  it has a line-in recording jack wich can come in handy.  it can play videos, also. the screen is small for watching a movie on it (approx 1 7/8"), but i do not watch movies on this or any other player's screen.  even 3" is too small! at a time when nobody owns anything smaller than a 40" hd flatscreen why in the world would you want to watch a movie on that little thing?? anyway, for me personally simplicity and superior sound quality are what i look for in such a gadget.  now, i do not use my home system cd player any more: i plug this thing into my receiver and have access to my collection in high definition music cd quality.  i get in my car, same thing. no more cd's to lose, scratch, destroy or forget where i put them.  they are all archived on both my computer's drive and the cowon's. it's sad to see this, but we're all flocking to buy products like ipod and zune which do nothing but impose more and more restrictions upon us: buy (or should i say, rent) music only from their sites, use only their sorry proprietary formats, force us to use their proprietary itunes and such programs, which invade, crash and slow down your computer and so forth.  not to mention zune, which will not even play window media files!!!.  in conclusion, this product is definitely worth looking at.  it gives you the freedom and flexibility to do a lot of things with your music.    
the nano is in beat up condition but it is used. very fast shipping and i couldn't have asked for a smoother transaction. thanks.  
perhaps i should start with a rebuttal to the bad reviews i've read. the player is very lightweight. this doesn't necessarily mean cheap. what do you expect? it's made of plastic with a few small integrated circuits. the supposed metal band is actually chrome plated plastic. it is not advertised as made of metal so why complain. it doesn't have a built-in rechargeable battery. good, when the single aaa cell runs down i can chuck it and put another in. at four for a buck that's better than waiting three to five hours for a non-replaceable battery to charge. if you want a rechargeable battery then go buy one for a couple of bucks and buy the optional charger. you have to remove the battery cover to access the sd card slot. good, it keeps the dirt out of the slot. the instructions say it can only use a 512 mb sd card but my 1gb card works fine. the earphones stay in my ears just fine. that said, here's my review. i'll focus on what was important to me. you can read about some other features in other reviews.  the good:  1. lightweight. 2. replaceable aaa battery or optional rechargeable battery and charger. 3. excellent sound (no funny background noise like some other players. 4. excellent noise blocking earphones. 5. sd card expansion slot good for at least 1 gb.  the bad:  1. the display is virtually unreadable when the backlight is off. you should have the option of changing the white on black display to black on white. it would be readable without the backlight then. 2. no folder management in the menus. you have to step through every track to find the one you want (except you can switch from internal memory to the sd card as a shortcut). careful use of file names and id3 tags helps to find things. 3. no case. i got an adequate very inexpensive case made by case logic. 4. eats batteries like a demon. when i use it regularly i can easily go through two batteries a day. well, that's fifty cents a day under heavy use. i may think about getting the charger and some rechargable batteries but alkaline batteries are cheap and convenient.  overall it's an excellent player.  
i wanted desperately to love this device (the ultra-cool big touch screen, the external speakers and the ample 80 gb hard drive) but after spending countless hours of trying to transfer music files with no success i am sending it back. also, after transferring my photo files onto this device, about a third of my images would show up greened-out with just a sliver of image showing. however, all the thumbnails showed up fine. that is definitely a defect in my particular device. the opera web browser is sluggish and the touch screen doesn't always respond to either your finger or the stylus. when you use your finger, the screen does that funny ripply effect. i imagine that after some time you could actually damage the touch screen by using your finger. the pdf instructions of this device that i downloaded onto to my regular laptop are not as clear cut as they should be.  i will not say "don't buy this device" because i am sure that many of you can figure out how to make the best use of all the features of the archos 704 wifi. for those who are looking for ease of use, however, please give purchasing this machine a second thought.  
dont waste your money on an ipod.  the zen is really easy to use and i use limewire to download music so i didnt spend any extra money on buying music. the battery lasts a long time too which is nice, once you charge it completely the first time you only have to charge it about once every week and a half, depending on how often you use it. its also really small and light it almost disappears in your hand, but the screen looks awesome for such a small device.  also, fyi creative actually sued apple in 2006 for infringement of the zen patent, the case was settled for $612 million       
bought this as a present for my girl's birthday, and it is really very tiny. the pictures do not provide a good reference point, but we are talking about half a pack of smokes in size. a good little player from what i can tell, she loves it.  
i own the 8gb player, not the 12gb, but i hate it so much i thought i'd let anyone considering this version know as well.  normally, i really try and shy away from 1 star ratings, but this product i'm afraid warranted it. i have not had good luck with its reliability. a month into owning it, it stopped completing its start-up cycle. trekstor was was fairly nice about having me return it for a replacement (tho they didn't send me pre-payed shipping labels like hp has). now giving them the benefit of the doubt, it could have been a fluke and a bad unit. but immediately upon receiving the second one, it gives faulty "back cover removed" errors and shuts off. since it's more than 90 days since i bought it from jr electronics thru amazon, they will not let me return it to them.  so i payed for this one to be returned as well, and it hasn't completely died on me yet.  that said, here's how i rate the non-reliability issues:  pros -really elegant, snazzy look -great drag-and-drop way of adding/removing songs; it appears as a usb disk. -allegedly wide variety of supported formats  cons -rotating wheel control is sometimes cumbersome and redundant with other buttons that do the same thing -player has trouble with .oggs unless they are perfectly encoded; it's not that it won't play them--it plays them, then freezes up at the end of the song, and won't respond to anything until the battery has been removed *and then* the unit has been plugged into your usb port. -other random freezeups too.  
i purchased this item and found after spending a few hours of downloading songs, that it was defective. i was disappointed because i was looking forward to getting this item.i contacted your customer service dept and was given instructions on returns,your return process is very efficient and i received a 2nd mp3. the only problem is up to this point it was about 3 weeks from when i originally ordered the item. after spending another 2 hours or so downloading and listening to songs i discovered that this mp3 also was slightly defective also. when listening to songs, only on certain songs, it would lock up and the whole system would just shut off. i did not want to go through another return process and downloading session and i really like this mp3 so even though it is defective,i decided to keep it anyway. i also want you to know that when purchasing the item, i saw no indication on the screen of your website where it said that it was a remanufactured item. i only discovered it after the purchase.  
i purchased the iriver h10 20gb (blue) about three weeks ago after saving and researching for about 6 months.  in summary, i have been very happy with the player and would definitely buy it again.    the good  the sound quality is very good.  the included ear buds are fine (i'm not a fan of ear buds in general), but the source is clean and accurate and you can spend as much or as little on after-market headphones as you like.  there is a lot of control over the eq.  virtually all of my music is in variable bit rate mp3 format.  the h10 supports mp3 and the microsoft format (wmf).  i don't use itunes (acc) or audible so lack of support for those formats is not an issue for me.  the form factor is nice.  it's about the same size as a deck of cards and fairly light.  it fits in my hand or a pocket easily.  the user interface works well with either one or two hands.  the controls are simple, intuitive and make sense.  (i recommend you read the short manual or it might take you a while to stumble onto some of the more subtle features.)  the thumb slider works well, even with a large list to scroll through-when your thumb hits the end of the slider, the display keeps scrolling.  using the slider to control volume rather than a physical knob or wheel is a good idea.  one of my main reasons for picking the h10 was the fm tuner.  i like to listen to national public radio and other local stations.  the tuner has good reception and it is easy to program stations as presets.  i have used the ability to record an fm transmission a few times already.  the color display is bright and clear.  the screen layouts make sense and have useful information.  i don't have a reason to use the player to display pictures (other than when showing off the player), but it does have this ability.  i had no problems getting windows xp to recognize the player-it shows up as a usb drive.  data transfer rates have been good for a usb device.  i've loaded my entire library several times as i've played with different software besides windows media player.  it takes about an hour and a half to transfer 12gb.  some reviewers have complained that the player locks up when they used windows to browse the player's hard drive.  it does take a while to display the contents of folders on the player, but i haven't had the player or windows actually lock up.  the battery life has been good.  i've taken it on a couple of multi-day trips and haven't run it down completely.  the ok  the player is designed to work with microsoft windows media player 10 (included on cd with the player).  wmp does all of the basic things you want:  rip, organize, update id3 tags, build playlists, sync with the player.  of course it takes microsoft's typical "software for dummies" approach-it doesn't do any of the things as well as some other programs and you can't change the way it behaves, where it stores your music files, etc.  ("sorry ma'am, but you don't need to know the bit rate we're using to encode your music.  move along now...")  but, if you are willing to be assimilated (resistance is futile!), it can manage your music collection and player adequately.  fortunately, because you can copy the music files directly to the player using windows, you can use any software you wish.  i like to use freerip to create the mp3 files-it works very well, queries freedb so you don't have to type in any information, supports variable bit rate encoding, and is free.  to use the player with a lot of content, having clean id3 tags is critical.  id3 tags store the information about the music file (artist, album, title, genre, etc.) in the mp3 file.  i tried windows media player, but again ended up using a different free program (mp3tag) that worked better, especially when cleaning up hundred of files at a time.  some reviewers have complained that the player will not play songs in the order that they were on the album.  remember that the players has only the information in the id3 tags and the file names to work with.  it doesn't seem to use the "track" tag, but you can get it to play in album order if you include the track number in the file name and play songs in alphabetic order.  for example, i name my music files "artist - album - track# - songtitle.mp3."  99% of the time i have the player on random shuffle.  i'm still looking for a program that can make it easier to sync the player and manage playlists.    i don't expect the software to be an issue for the typical owner-i tend to be very particular.  i suppose the support for text files is useful, if you wanted to keep some reference files on the device.  i've read novels on a palm pilot, so i'm not opposed to using a small device for reading, but electronic devices have a long way to go to before they can match the performance and convenience of paper for pleasure reading.  some reviewers have mentioned having to upgrade the firmware and having to remove the battery to reset the player.  the h10 20gb does not have a firmware upgrade release yet, and it resets very easily by pressing a small recessed button with a paper clip.  i have had to reset the player a couple of times, but it reboots quickly and this hasn't been a big deal.  the bad  bad is relative.  nothing i've encountered with the player is truly "bad."   probably my worst complaint is that there is a brittle-sounding click in the headphones as the player changes songs.  i don't really notice it any more, but at first it was annoying.  i like to listen to longer material, audio books and old radio programs, and fast-forwarding to a mid-point to resume listening can take a while, even with the scan rate set to max (6x).  a progressive scan (longer you hold it down, the faster it goes) would be more effective and intuitive.  the player comes with a white translucent silicone protective cover.  it has a belt clip and is soft and does a good job of protecting the player, even if it is not the most attractive thing i've seen.  i've listed it under the bad category because it also makes it difficult to feel the prev track/play/next track buttons through the silicone.  i haven't had to call iriver for support yet, but have no illusions about the quality of live support that will be available.  unfortunately, no one provides good customer support.  best we can hope for is a device that is made well enough that the need for support is rare.  so far, the h10 20gb seems to fall into this category.  because the player is designed to be a copy of your master library, there's no obvious way to delete files (even ones you've recorded using the player's fm tuner) using the player's interface.  you have to connect it to your computer for this.  there's also no obvious way to figure out how much disk space is left on the player, either from the player or from windows.  as a work-around, i add up the size of the various media directory trees on my computer to estimate how much space is left.  i'm hoping both of these are addressed by firmware upgrades.   oh.. and i wish i had gotten red.  
i have had my av700 for about three weeks and started by loading several episodes of mister rogers' for my daughter to be able to watch during long drives while we vacationed across the cascade mountain range.    the interface is mostly textual so it is touch and go whether a four year old can use the device unassisted, but passing it from back seat to the front my wife or i could queue up a new episode when she wanted one.   my video source is a mix of hdtv and standard definition programs recorded using beyondtv on a winxp-mce box.  i did not like the video conversion software included with the device due to errors in the mpeg handling and limited filter support.    standard definition 4:3 doesn't fill the player's screen so some tweaking of crop settings and scaling is needed to get an image that offers the best compromise of size, distortion, and image area.  currently i use virtualdub-mpeg2 for batch conversion of 4:3 recorded standard definition tv source material.  we also used the player to watch one movie and two masterpiece theater adaptations.  pulling the movie off of dvd was a pain and the final result had sound levels too low to hear easily with the built in speakers and the limited volume range of the device.  tv source materials with their compressed dynamic range were more than loud enough however.    moving 16:9 hdtv to the device wasn't something that i figured out how to do until returning home as there are almost no tools that support hdtv transport streams.  for batch encoding hdtv i am currently using mencoder from the command-line driven with a bit of glue code written in perl, but it is still a challenge to determine which of the video and audio channels in the transport stream holds the content that i really wanted to convert (with the result of a missed guess giving me badly distorted 4:3 480i instead of 16:9 1080i, or worse the wrong program entirely.)  the manufacturer seems to expect people to record video directly into the device but manually queueing programs and waiting an hour to transfer one program to the device frankly has no appeal to me.  getting digital video directly off of my pvr is the only use that has appeal and it still suffers from bleeding edge usability issues, but will work with perseverence.  
wrong product..  wrong time.   consumers of us have been offered new electronics products almost everyday. but how many times we look at them and say, "i want that!" palmone's lifedrive is not going to make you say that, either.  major features of the product: * palm os 5.4 * intel processor * 4g hd * wi-fi 802.11b * bluetooth 1.1 * usb 2.0 * big color display * support for microsoft documents * voice recorder * camera companion software * mp3 player  this is not impressive.if palmone wants to be ahead of the curve, they should have added wi-fi 802.11g. bluetooth and usb 2.0 are pretty much necessary and they are good there.   lets do a quick comparison of this product,  palmone treo 650: $400 (and lot cheaper with cell phone service annual contract) features: cell, pda, camera, mp3 player, speakerphone, bluetooth, 23mb nokia 6620: $350 (less than $100 with annual plan)  features: cell, pda, camera, mp3 player, speakerphone, bluetooth 12mb  why am i comparing with cell phones? because we have to have one and what is missing in them is the big hard-drive. for that, i am not going to buy lifedrive. i will rather just a get a usb drive/firewire drive for 50 bucks which i don't need to upgrade or something, or better yet, an ipod which is an excellent usb hard-drive (ipod photo fo 30g $349)  if palmone is thinking that this device is going to fill the gap between your office computer, home computer, camera, i think they are wrong. we need little more integration like combination of a nokia cell,  pda, apple mp3 player, small sony camera, big hitachi hard drive. and all of this still should be bigger than the palm treo.  bottom line: i wouldn't waste my money on this. i am sure something more worthwhile will come before end of this year.  
main reason to buy an mp3 player is for music! this player sounds ok with included earbuds, but if you try to use a full size set of headphones the volume and sound quality is severly lacking. i personally can't stand earbuds, they don't stay in my ears, plus the sound quality from headphones is usually much better.  pros- -looks like a little ipod -included earbuds sound pretty good (but not great) -has fm tuner  cons- -very s l o w usb 1.1 transfer speeds, takes forever to load songs to device -when using headphones, volume at full up is lacking, sound not very good through headphones -sound quality not on a par with other mp3 players i have tried -limited information about song displayed -must use musicmatch from philips site to transfer songs, not the best application for this purpose -overall, pales in comparison to offerings from rio and creative  i suggest you do some homework before buying this item!  why did i buy this item? i got it on a deal directly from philips for a much lower price than listed here, still i wasted my money, gave it to my sister!   
i have had this mp-3 player for about 3 months, and i am extremely satisfied with it. i like it's small size and many features. it it broke tomorrow, i would immediately order another one.  the sound is great and the screen is crisp and clear. i bought a pack of pda screen protectors and trim them to the size of this screen to keep it from getting scratched. the programming and downloading to this device was a little confusing at first, but i soon got the hang of it. i take it everywhere with me, and use it everyday. i did get another set of earphones, because i don't like ear-buds. one reviewer panned this unit because it dosen't have a replaceable battery.  in todays fast-paced technology and throw-away world, i'm sure the life of the battery and the life of this unit will pretty much equal out. another reviewer complained that the unit can "turn itself on."  the easy fix for this is to activate the hold button after turning it off. i would highly recommend this mp-3 player to anyone looking for quality - resonably priced portable music player.     
malfunctions: 1. the port for connecting to a pc became loose and unreliable, frequently disconnecting while i was trying to transfer music. 2. the little knob stopped working properly:  it was no longer possible to fast-forward. 3. finally, the screen cracked for me and no longer displayed anything.  design issues: it would be nice to be able to access music by id3 tag (i.e. artist, genre, song title). it takes a long time to start up, generally ~20 seconds but up to ~2 minutes if you just changed the music on it. it's nice that you can delete music on the player without having to connect it to a computer, for instance if you have it on shuffle and you come across something that you never want to hear again.  however, the interface to do this was so inconvenient (including audio playback stopping and long lag times) that i rarely used this feature in practice. the earbuds that come with it didn't stay in my ears well; i bought new ones.  good things: i loved the fact that it had an fm radio and a voice recorder (the reasons that i bought it). it's easy to access the hard drive from any computer, without any software needed. the large storage capacity proved fully necessary. you can change playback modes with a single button press (shuffle versus ordered, all songs versus current folder only).  my basis for comparison:  i've also owned a creative zen jukebox (which i liked a lot but which i sold because i wanted the fm radio and voice recorder on the iaudio) and, currently, a used fourth generation ipod, which has been working well so far except for some occasional quirks.  
though i am not prone to writing these kinds of things i thought i'd better after my recent experience with archos.  this company, hands down has the worst costumer service i've ever had to deal with.  you be the judge.  i bought a gmini 200 last feburary.  it worked ok but froze up alot.  then in oct. it wouldn't charge any more.  after a few calls and e-mails i get an rma and send it back.  one month later a replacement arrives.  two months later the hard drive on this one goes.  i loose everything.  a few more phone calls to their costumer service and i get another rma and send it back.  for the next month i must have called at least 10 times about the player.  each time i'm on hold for a minimum of 45 minutes.  when i do get through i get all kinds of confusion about my player.  a couple of times they have no record of receiving the player.  they loose me in their system.  they tell me three times that they are sending a new one and will e-mail me.  they don't and it never arrives.  finally, fed up i request a supervisor.  he's sympathetic, apologizes and says for my troubles he will send me an upgrade to the gmini 400.  weeks go by and yet i call but no player.  i'm told they are on back order.  finally nearly two months since sending it back the second time my new player arrives.  and oh, by the way it's not the upgraded player i was told they were sending.  so for the year thay i owned the gmini 200 i've had it in my possession for nine months.  since the warranty has now expired i asked if they would extend it.  they said sure, no problem, we'll send you an e-mail confirming.  well that's been two weeks ago and i've given up any hope.    sometimes a product is only as good as it's costumer service.  i've learned my lesson with archos and only hope people will read and consider this if thinking about spending their hard earned money on such incompetence.  read about others at www.archossucks.com       
plastic casing looks so cheap, earphones looks generic, compared to ipods , quality is incomparable. sonic stage software, is hard to manage, worked fine with windows xp pro, but when updated the ver 3.0 that originally came with the player to ver 4.2 fialed to work had to go back to ver 3.0 and ver 3.0 doesn't  work on windows xp mediacenter.  sound is decent enough but max volume is not loud enough.   
i've had this thing for almost 2 months now and i absolutely love it. i use it everyday and the battery life is never an issue when i'm listening to music. i wish i'd bought a car adapter so that i could watch movies and charge in between because one full-length movie will take most of the life out of the battery, but you can get away with a movie and a few hours of music if you don't leave the backlighting on all the time. its very intuitive to use and the instrucions it comes with are clear. it was essentially a plug-n-play device because i already has windows media player 10 on my pc and i'm yet to have any problems with it at all. i haven't put any pictures on it but from watching movies i can say that if you put high quality stuff in you certainly get high quality out. and it was able to convert almost every file on my computer to a usuable format...there were 5 it couldnt take care of out of around 2 thousand. i rave about it to everyone.  
8/9/05 updates:  so far so good. i am still enjoying my iriver. i think my friend wants one, but it's kind of a waste of money since he doesn't even have a 128 cd case yet, and hasn't filled his 64. besides, he has windows 98, and the iriver is only compatable with xp, mac os 9, and mac os x. the reason i am resumbitting my review is to point out a couple of things i didn't mention before.  1) songs cannot play in album order. though you can do this by using the quick list, it becomes frustratingg after awhile.  2) the battery life seemingly lasts more than 16 hours under normal use, more around 20-22 hours, depending on your usage.  3) the battery is not swappable, however, iriver's site said yet...meaning they are making a swapple battery for the h10-20gb. the battery lasts around 4 years, however shortens slowly after the third year. iriver's website states at 4 years, the battery life will be dropped around -4 hours. which means even if you get it now your battery will never die.  4) the player does seem to support .wav files. i by accident added a .wav file and my friend accidentally played it. the player played the four minute .wav file just fine without hesistation.  5) you can not add a song to an exisiting playlist that has been added to the player, a little frustrating. you have to delete the file in my computer and then add the song again. this could take an immense amount of time if you want to add a large amount of certain songs.  6) imo, cnet's review should be redone, as they say the navigation is difficult, when it's easy as pie.  so far, i still love my iriver. so, it's not 100% perfect, but the firmware hasn't even been upgradeable yet, meaning they are working on some new firmware for the h10-20gb.  and, if you haven't read my earlier review, it is posted below.  7/5/05:  i recently bought and returned the yh925gs. not only did it not have an fm tuner (didn't care that much), but adding, modifying, and deleting files was becoming a big pain.   the mp3 player is pretty slim, even though it's not the slimmest one you can buy, it's light so if you like jogging with it or excersising you'll barely notice it. like all 20 gb mp3 players, you can store 5,000 songs (approx. 400 cds). the controls look strange at first, but actually, all you need to control is the touchpad. there are also arrows for them most easy navigation. you'll notice that it's easier to use than most mp3 players on the market today. the battery life is 16 hours. some of today's players have more than 20 hours, but i guess 16 is okay.   the player also comes with a 1.8" lcd screen, and more colors than a computer so your photos will look of professional quality. on this player, something that most if not all players can't do, is view .txt files. this is a really cool feature. you can store lyrics or essays in notepad, then transfer them into the player. this is a very cool feature that i will be using more often.   the sound is really good. it doesn't have wow features that most mp3 players have, but it has a very decent equalizer. the sound isn't distored at all, and i'm suprised about this.   the player also comes with recordings and fm tuning. the microphone can pick up voice pretty far, and the fm tuner is quite good too. there are also 20-preset stations for your tuner. and listen to this one, you can rip off of the radio. how cool is that? say your listen to the radio, and you hear this hot new track that is so good, you can just press record, and you can listen to it whenever you want. it's not that other players don't do this, it's that this is the 1 of 2 players that has the fantasic combination of 20 gb, radio, and recording. (the iaudio x5 is the other player that has this...i didn't buy it because it doesn't allow you to change track settings, wtf?)   it's also playsforsure compatible, but to use wmp 10, you have to download the drivers from the iriver website. unless you have a lot of music on wmp, i would just stick to the drag-n-drop. it's not just drag-n-drop (e.g. my computer, iriver) or wmp 10 that's compatable. realplayer is compatable, and napster is too (but i think napster sucks). to put photos on your mp3 player, you can use the manual drag-n-drop. as a matter of fact, the my computer>iriver method is probably the best. i have no reason why you would want/need wmp 10 or real to manage music. though, i guess to have further options, you would need it. but otherwise, it's very easy to add tracks since you can drag-n-drop. but remember, if you can't get windows to understand the h10, you'll need to go to iriver's website and download the new drivers. i wish they would give you the drivers beforehand, because some people with computers may not have internet.   overall, if you want the great combination of 20 gb, wma and mp3, recording, drag-n-drop (no hassle with wmp or real), and fm radio, you just have to have the h10.  
had a zen xtra 40gb player that was great except for the toggle switch.  the zen touch fixed this with the touch scroller, but it is a little hard to get a handle on.  sound was great using 3rd party earbud headphones or when connected to another stereo.  industrial design/build/feel of the unit is greatly improved over previous versions.  skip using the included software and just use media player 10 for free - works much better for organizing music and keeps all the same details on the player as well - cataloging, file extensions, etc.  the big problem with mine and my neighbor's 20gb zen touch is that it constantly locks up while playing.  you can hear the disk spinning/grinding.  neither unit has been dropped and we have run scan disks and are running the latest firmware.  i am returning my today!  iriver will be next on my list.....  
this product is a piece of junk. within a month the display started going and i had to reload the firmware. just after one year, the player wouldn't work (kept starting in recovery mode). the online creative knowledge base was of no help, and they would not help me further without charging me. overly sensitive touch controls. won't buy a creative product again.   
i am very satisfied with the product and as always the service of amazon was excellent, the only disadvantage was that during the use the cable of the earpieces brokes and is only working one of the exits, by the others the product as equipment surpasses the expectations with the handling of the archives, the sport fusions and fm radio with the recording by several hours, very useful for the interest programs.  
i am running a mac os 10.3 and i bought this because the store was out of ipods and i needed an mp3 player quick. on the box it says that this is a mac compatable mp3 player.  first of all, there is absolutely no support for macs on the printed manual or the cd disc that comes with it. there is also no support on the web page, everything is pc geared so any updates for your player will be unavailable to you. second of all, if you've been using itunes then this player will not recognize any of the tags except for "song"; everything else comes up "unknown". if you're buying the 40gig player, that is a lot of songs you're going to have to manually change for this player. i guess it makes sense that they wouldn't try to gear this to mac users since they should know that the ipod is far superior (and it is). even if you're not a mac user you should shell out the extra $100 for the ipod; you won't regret it. my roommate has a pc and an ipod and he loves itunes over "media player" and he loves his ipod too.  
this is an excellent video mp3 player,that i perfer over the i pod.yes i like this better...the unit has very good sound...the screen is bright and sharp...i have transfered 150 songs and a few pictures to this unit...i have only used about 5 percent of its many features...the archos is a real gem...if you purchase this item please make sure the retailer as a good refund/exchange policy,of at least 30 days...i highly recommend this unit 5 star rated thank you stewart l.  
i got the product within the day the email was sent that it had been shipped and in perfect condition.  
i bought this item a few months ago and it works great! the aaa batteries last a long time. adding songs is so easy, you can synch songs onto it via windows media player, you don't even need to use the software. in terms of making a playlist, all you have to do is title your songs with the number you want them to be. for example if your song is "mysong.mp3" all you have to do is title it "01mysong.mp3" and the next "02myothersong.mp3" and they will be in that order on the mp3player. if you want to put another song in between just title it "015myotherothersong.mp3" and no problem it works. i also recommend converting your files you want to add into .wma format. you can decrease the file size significantly and over normal decent headphones the audio quality is not noticably different at all. this way you don't even need a 1gb, i got a 512 and it fits tons, i haven't even filled it up yet. i really recommend this player!  
i could type all day about the knitpicky waa waa of ipods and zen players, but what it boils down to is simple, really.  the new series of zen players are well worth the coin; they're functional; they look good; they sound fantastic, and they cost less than an ipod.  bottom line.  but hey - buy an ipod if you want - steve jobs is the laughing all the way to the bank.   for the record, it was creative that invented the portable music player, but it was apple that created something unique with the concept and put marketing muscle behind it.  if you want to be specific, you could say that the ipod is actually an expensive knockoff of the of the older circa 1999 players - yes 1999!  was there an ipod back then?  nope.  
so i have seen two pretty bad reviews here and let me tell you, those people are doing something wrong!  i have had my sony network walkman for 2 days now and i love it!!   this is my first mp3 player and being the technology idiot that i am, i was afraid that i would get this thing and it would take me days to figure out how to use it.  well, within 15 minutes i was beginning the process of transfering the better part of my music collection onto this itsy bitsy tiny little thing.  it was so easy to use the software.  it even came with 5 free music downloads from sonicstage.  the thing i am most impressed with is the sound quality.  the only songs that suffered any quality (only a little bit) are songs that are copies of songs that are copies of songs that are copies of songs.  understandable.  but the rest of them are crystal clear.  you can adjust the eq only a little bit, but for me, its enough.  i like the bass a little heavy and this player satisfies that.   all in all, i believe that i got really got my money's worth.  this absolutely a great purchase, i love it, i love it, i love it!    
when i was shopping for our kids x-mas presents here on amazon i thought an inexpensive mp3 player would fit the bill. checking out the literature and reviews nothing indicated there would be compatiblity problems with apple products. we purchased two zen nanos only to find out the ugly truth, not only do mp3 players work only with microsoft products, only ipods work with apple products.    
i think people are just too hard on the reviews.    if you ask me, i think this is a great deal. it's small, light weight, has a lcd screen, scrolling capabilities, and the sound is great.   people are just stupid when it comes to writing crap. i got mine from wal-mart.  i think it's a great deal.  now, i'm sure there is much better ones out there.. but for the price this will do me just fine.    i haven't had a problem with it, and the transferring speeds do not take a minute.  i loaded 300 songs in less than 10 minutes.  how fast do you want it? honestly?  the storage capacity is great too, i think they are stretching the 1000 songs u can put on, but even still you can put over 700 on it easily. and you dont need more. if you are looking for that, then u may as well get a ipod as they are made for storage.  it tells you on the box to use windows media player to sync your songs.. that is what i used and i didn't have a single problem minus one or two songs couldn't convert. but i easily fixed that by downloading it again.    the battery life lasts for about 5-6 hours, depending on what your features you have turned on.  for example... if you have the lcd screen on all the time then obviously it is going to drain the battery faster. they say it could last 10 hours, i dont see that, but maybe, if you have the sound turned low, no lcd.. then.... maaaaybe...  features on this are good, has a bass boost, 5 equalizer presets, the lcd screen is a great feature. and it has a mic built in which works great, if you need to record something than this would work great for it. the mic will pick up even the quiet sounds.  sometimes a bit too much. there is a couple other features that you can look into by reading.  all in all, the product i think is great, i almost wnat to give it a 5 out of 5, but again, im sure there is better ones out there.. but just not at this price.  
i really wanted to keep this unit.  the av700 is a class act.  i liked everything about the unit itself--build quality was excellent, as was the screen.  the interface was a little klunky (compared to an ipod, for example), but was not a significant factor.  however, i returned it.  why? in short, i could not get the av700 to work with my tv system.  first of all, and most importantly, the supplied cables are very short--i think they're 3 feet long, if that.  even though all my components are in a cabinet, the cables weren't long enough.  and, because they are special cables, i couldn't just go to radio shack and buy longer ones.  i think this is quite "short-sighted" (excuse the pun).  the cables should be at least 6 feet long for almost any current television equipment installation.  so, the av700 was pretty much dead in the water for me, just based on the cable length (i also have to include the dock cable in the indictment.  i think it's less than a foot long and protrudes from one side and inflexible so as to severely limit installment options.) second, the instructions were quite general and, for a video novice like me, inadequate.  there were no more comprehensive instructions on the archos website either.  i've been around computers for many years, but haven't done much in the way of multimedia setup.  i looked at my installation and tried to follow the instructions as best as i could, but i never got video to the av700.  i am sure that a video-savvy person wouldn't have experienced this.  however, i would caution a potential buyer who doesn't have such experience to expect difficulty with installation. so, quite reluctantly, i returned the unit.  i really wanted it to work.  archos could remedy the situation with longer cables and better instructions--either in print or on the website.  until then, i would advise caution before purchasing the av700.  
good quality sound. holds up to 3,000 songs and still has an f.m. radio. also this baby coms with a built in mic so u are able to record lectures and also record off the radio. i would definitly get this over an ipod mini.  
i love my dell dj.  20 gig hard drive that can hold 10,000 songs, great sound quality and stability, easy-to-use interface, seriously, what could be better?  i love being able to store every single song i own on such a little device.  i have a lot of music (over 5,600 songs) so the extra storage space is greatly needed.  and it sounds great!  i love the earbuds that it came with, except i sometimes have trouble getting them to stay in my ear.  i also bought a cassette adapter so i can take my music on the road.  another feature i like is the ability to create a playlist on the machine itself.  with the ipod mini i used to have, the only way to create a playlist was on the computer.  the musicmatch jukebox softeware is not the most user friendly or the most reliable, but it gets the job done.    this is an excellent player all the way around.  dell discontinued these, so you might have to do some hunting in order to find one (i suggest ebay), but it will be well worth your invested time and money.  
first, all those people that say it takes for ever to scroll through the music are just wrong.  i have nearly 10k songs on the device and it scrolls through the music faster than an ipod, which i also own. it is better functionally than the ipod, although it lacks in add-ons (except for the remote which is far better than anything by apple). now the downside.  sonicstage is just awful.  it is glitchy, the major one being that for no reason it can stop working and nobody at sony can figure out how to fix it.  the program is very cumbersome, you can configure your music, but it is a royal pain.  although i am not a big fan of i-tunes, it is far superior to sonicstage.  i would buy it over an ipod for the device is better, but be very leary of the sony software, it sucks. i think the industry is missing the boat on forcing you to use there interfaces rather than a third party's (i.e. microsoft's).  
before i bought me a zune player. i had this little player for like a year and half. its a great player. sometimes i still use it for voice recording for my exams in college. since the zune does not have a voice recorder. i recommend this one.  
i got an ipod mini as a gift from my parents for my birthday almost 2 years ago. i have had to have the  apple store replace it with a new one twice. the first one that i got wouldn't turn on at all. the second one, the wheel wouldn't stay locked, then it wouldn't hold a charge, and by the time i brought back to the store it was completely spazzing. the third and most recent replacement mini that they gave me had been working fine but as i was using it, all of a sudden the screen faded so now the screen is useless. the people at the apple store told me that they had never seen this happen before and had no idea why it happened. its not under warranty anymore and they told me that the only thing i could do  would be to send it to an online repair shop or basically use it as an ipod shuffle. i never dropped any of the ipods, they never got wet, there is no rhyme or reason (even the mac genius' couldn't figure out why this has happened) for why i have had 3 of them not work. this ipod mini has been nothing but a hassle for the past 2 years, please save yourself the time, effort, and money. i wish someone had warned me.  
this is my first mp3 player and i just chose it after a good research over net and considering my budget.at first wanted to buy an ipod but considering the fact that,going to buy a pmp in near future,decided to go with flash-based players and also lower the price as much as i can my choices now become:creative zen n200-shuffle-nwe100 series.considering shuffles lack of features my main choice became n200 because of low price and featured-pack  package,but when i saw all those awfull ratings reviewers gave it and seeing it at store i went with my last choie:nw-e103 cause it has the nearest price to n200 and never go back. and now my expressions: after i got it,i must say it is very beautiful and stylish(i picked the one with orange color)to hide in your pocket!and also very small.sound quality is extreme as expected from sony products dont let other reviewers confuse you,it is excellent. and for the software side you can either drag&drop by updating mp3 file manager to v.2.o or using sonicstage 3.0-i must say after reading all those reviews which say it is a crap i found it very useful and also beautiful ui you can with a little effort import all your library and(you must rearrenge it) and then transfer them.you can also convert your songs to atrack3/plus and reduce their size so that you can double or triple your players space,wich i find very nice and useful,you can play with the settings and choose the bitrate that best suits you-in most cases you cant tell the diffrence after compression. the unit itself is well-built and can last a long time.face plate buttons are very intuitive and nice my only compliant is the usb cover and hold switch wich are not that easy to operate and wish it had 512mb or 1gb thats why i gave it 4 stars. over all very happy to buy it and recommend it.  
great products!!!  i did a lot of research on which one i wanted and i have to say the av500 is better if you are looking at picture quality.  they both do the same thing, except the 700 has games.  if you want more than one person to watch go with the 700 but for personal use get the 500.  i ordered both to try them out and then returned the 700, i thank amazon for making it so easy.    
i have had mine for about 3 mobths.  it does exactly what i want it to do. i wanted it to play music in the car as i have a daily commute to work.  i have a tape player in my car, so i bought a tape deck converter and play the music from the sony network walkman through the stero system of my car.  the network walkman is very easy to use and the battery life is long.  just remember to turn it off!  in my case when i turn off the car, the player is still playing and i have to manually turn it off or it runs down the battery.  the only thing that disappoints me about it, is now they have come out with the cutest pink/gray version.  very girly and fun!  
this is a great item, liek a mini tivo for on the go people, recoreds from tv, computer, dvd directly, awesome item.....  
the best thing about this player is the four way navigation buttons.  if you find wheels and touch-sensitive strips irritating, this is the mp3 player for you.  simply press the ^ and v buttons to scroll, > to skip or select, &lt; to go back, play to start or stop, menu to change the settings, and mode to switch the browser between artist, album, genre, etc..  the whole thing is very intuitive after just a few minuets of use.      the display is very clear and informative, the exception being that the battery display has only three sections, making it not that usefull.    the whole thing is rock solid yet very light, and the on/off switch is so flat and sunken it will never be turned on by accident.  one time i dropped it and it just hung on the end of the cord without hitting the floor it's so light.    the earbuds that come with it are strangely shaped and hurt my ears so i dont use them.  the so called 'carrying case' is just a felt cover to prevent scratches, not padded or anything(but still nice to have).    the sonicstage software is a bit sluggish, but if you just want to transfer files and use a different program for listening, i think it's fine.    i am confident this thing is going to last a long time beacause i got my sony cd player about five years ago and after much hard usage it still works great.    also, this thing can playback and charge at the same time so you can plug it in when it gets low on power without skipping a beat.    one of the best things is that if you set playback to random you can shuffle all songs, one artist, one album, one genre, etc. just by selecting it.     also don't listen to the guy who complained about the scroll speed.  first of all, there is no comprehensive list of individual songs, so there could not even be 3000 items to scroll through.  secondly, even if there was, the menu is wrap-around so it would only take half that long.  due to the multiple categories to organize tracks by, it could only take about 30 sec. tops to find the song you want.    overall the only three petty complaints i have are these: the ac/dc power adapter partially covers the on/off switch, so you can't turn on or off without taking the plug out(a minor annoyance), artists are organized alphabeticly even if they start with 'the', which i know is silly but it gets on my nerves, and thirdly, the shuffle algorithim is a little sketchy and seems to play some songs more than others. but belive me, if you can find a seller, buy it.   p.s. the battery is user-replacable, and you can probably find a new one at batteries plus.  
i really like this "curved" design, and the electric blue glow is cool (can't wait to play with it under the sheets with my girlfriend). have to remark to gadgester about "creative should hire some real industrial designers." that  j.ive's worked on toilets and wash basins before ipod, which probably explains the white of the original ipod and the metallic colors of the mini, they all remind me of public toilets. the beltclip on mini is really useless (unless you have small private parts and need to show your mini off to impress the girls - "look see girls, i spent wads of money girls, do you like me now?) the curved shape of micro plus its smaller size will make it easy to slip anywhere, mini was uncomfortable in my pocket, all those sharp edges sticking in me. good to see microsoft and creative team up with this product so that it will work on any pc running windows. think i'll leave ipods for the people who spend money to look cool, and get myself a zen micro as i value my music quality above what my friends think of me.  
i bought this because consumer reports gave it a high rating.  i should have read the reviews here first.  it won't even connect with our computer using a usb port i use all the time and we've tried 3 cords, 2 of which are verified.  the device just says 'connecting' and windows says the device is malfunctioning.  i hope we can get our money back since we ordered it through an amazon affiliate.  we've tried some of the settings suggestions posted here to no avail.  i would give it a negative star if that was an option.  maybe it's just this one that is a lemon.  but this is a real disappointment as it was a gift for my husband and i spent a lot of time researching this purchase.  paint me a sucker.  
you have to use their lousy sonicstage software to transfer songs to it. that is just stupid. well, not just stupid, arrogant also.  i was attracted to this thing becasue of it's size, battery life (which is exaggerated by at least 50%), radio tuner, and most of all its support of aac encoded files. apple's products have no radio tuners, and if you've chosen aac as your audio codec, you haven't been able to get a flash based player which will both play the radio and play your aac files.  kudos to sony for allowing it to play aac audio files, it's about time someone besides apple implemented this mpeg standardized codec in their "mp3" players, but why force poorly written software (sonicstage) down our throats? why force any software down our throats? with almost all flash based mp3 players you can just drag and drop your music files via your operating system; you just connect it as an external hard drive and drag and drop. then also you can use them from windows, macs, linux, whatever.  and why are they still pushing atrac codecs? it's a waste of their time and money, and the world does not need sony trying to push its own proprietary codecs. it's by no means superior to the standardized mpeg aac codec or microsoft's proprietary (although basically free) wma codecs. dear sony, your codec is not significant, it is not a player in the audio codec world, and the world is better off without you trying to push it on us. the same can be said about your other proprietary variations on standardized technologies, e.g. betamax and memory sticks. you just make the world more complicated, in the end you lose, and your market share goes to zero. (although i did think minidiscs were a good idea.)  it's a good piece of hardware, but in order to use it you have to jump through sony's hoops. just say no.   
i own an older model and have experienced battery issues. when the unit was on the market and battery concerns were mentioned and archos said that they would replace the battery if the need arose. well, i need a new battery and guess what they said. they suggested that i throw away my 20 gig/mp3 player/video player because they no longer support the unit because my model is not current! i can't beleive that something i bought for hundreds of dollars 2 years ago that needs a battery should be tossed.   they said if i found a battery that i would still need to find someone handy with solder. when i inquired about the specs of the battery they said they didn't have any of that info.   not to mention that the battery is dead dead and the unit will not turn on even when plugged in. i can't access any of my files.   what a crock. i think i will buy something from someone who cares next time. buyer beware.   
we have an h340 that is 3 months out of warranty.  when its internal battery stopped holding a charge we were told that we now had a "paperweight."  don't trust this brand.  
this is extremely hard to use and confusing. mine came without instructions. i accidentally pressed the "hold" button and have never since managed to get it off hold.  
my husband is digging his video ipod. he has pics of the grandkids on it and can share them at the gym while he works out...  
i got this mp3 player on my birthday and was a little dissapointed because it wasnt and ipod, well was i wrong! this player is very small easy to fit into any pocket. the sound is utterly amazing. my bro has an ipod and it is nice and all but it is bulky compared to this. i listen to this before i go to bed and it puts me to sleep great. i think if your wanting a radio, voice recorder, great sound and many other things, no doubt this is for you!  
this is one of the worst purchases i've ever made.   while the mp3 player itself is not bad, the software it forces you to use to transfer songs, is aboslutely awful. it will only organize songs by their id3 tags and sortof artist, album, etc. but the software will not allow you to create any kind of subdirecty what-so-ever and this drove me insane. if only have 10 albums, fine, if you only have albums made by one artist, fine. but if you have a soundtrack or a compilation album with multiple artists, the whole thing gets split up in alphabetical order according to artist. and if you want to sort by album, every album you have is listed on the main screen. personally, this way forced me to scroll down for literally minutes to get to an album a ways down the alphabet.  all i wanted to do was organize music so i didn't have to scroll through so much to get to something i actually wanted, but it was literally impossible. and there is no way around this software(sonicstage), i checked with sony support (i called repeatedly) and everyone i talked to said it is impossible, and judging from how many updates have come along for sonicstage, without this support, i don't see it happening in the future either.  stay away from this mp3 player, i highly suggest an ipod or an iriver brand player.  
i recently was given this mp3 player this christmas and so far it has worked beyond my expectations. the player is small and lightweight so it fits in my pocket and i dont eaven feel that it is there. the music playback is great and the radio is clear. when i first charged the battery i was amazed at how fast it took to charge(less than an hour). the earbuds are ok but who buys a mp3 player for the ear buds. the built in usb connector is a great thing to have because you dont need to mess with usb cables when you want to place music on it. the display is a bright organic electroluminescence display and is great for viewing in low light. the sonic stage softwhere takes a little while to get used to but is workable. overall this player is perfect for anyone in need of a compact, lightweight mp3 player.  
no problems here it does what it says it does and nothing more. i love it, only had it a week. (also own a lyra) it's has issues, but dont they all. for what you get you cant beat it.   
i got this to replace my iriver, which got stepped on and is now awaiting parts. heres a basic list of pros and cons: pros: 1) itunes is a breeze to work with. fantastic piece of software 2) its tiny, it holds 6gb in a tiny tiny space 3) it takes only seconds to transferr songs over via itunes 4) it is so easy to use. the click wheel interface is fantastic 5) battery life is now rated by apple at 18 hours but actually reaches 22 in good conditions!! brilliant!  cons: 1) sound quality, sound quality and again sound quality.compared to my old iriver it pales in comparison, but its not terrible, just a lot less than i was expecting. 2) built in equalizers are useless and do more harm than good. to be avoided at all costs. 3)cant copy music off the ipod( you can actually, but you have to do a bit of research and downloading of 3rd party software to do this.) 3) it doesnt like bit rates lower than 160kbps, which i know is a minium nowdays, but i have a lot of 128 kbps from years ago that sound way better in the iriver than the ipod. 4)no wall charger included. you have to charge via powered usb, which meant i had to buy a powered usb hub as my laptop has no powered usb port.this is a bad way to cut costs.also means your pc will have to be on when charging and this is bad if you charge at nite, when your pc is off. 5) easily scratched and you will need a case to keep it looking good.  thats a short list of pros and cons. id definately recommend it but you really need to buy new headphones to make the most of it.  
i am the unhappy owner of several h10's and initially there were minor problems, but the closer they got to the end of the warranty period, the more problems they started having.  problems include freezing up for no apparent reason, scrolling in chinese, and the most irritating is when the "system files are missing" and you have to reinstall the firmware and redownload all of your music (does this alot).  the company doesn't believe in customer service - you can't get through on the phone and they take days to respond to email.  i have returned two because the hard drives crashed and it took 3-4 weeks to get them back, and then one of them crashed again as soon as i got all the music redownloaded and i had to return it and wait another 3 weeks.  i have a problem with one that has now gone out of warranty and iriver told me they won't touch it and to look for a repair shop online.  so save yourself alot of headaches and time, not to mention money, and don't buy an h10 player.  
awesome concept, however i live in an apartment that doesn't have any south facing windows, so i was unable to get a signal.  i strongly advise against calling the xm radio help # from a phone that won't use up your cell phone minutes.  had to call them four different times, and all they did was read me the instruction manual, and tell me that if i don't have signal my radio won't work (i had clearly established that fact already).  i recieved the radio for free because of a rebate, and didn't even intend on getting xm radio, but figured since the unit was free, and an mp3 player, to give it a try.   i was going to break down and buy the $70 car kit but then i ran across the agt sportscaster for $20, which came with a car kit.  since i can't use it in my house, i hook up the home base to the car kit, and at least i can use it that way.  this ended up being a lot of work for something i wasn't sure i wanted in the first place.  haven't used the mp3 player yet, but napster does not seem the most user friendly.  (i have the majority of my songs on itunes)  
it looks like the best player ever made. until, of course, the warranty expires.   and then we find out everything wrong with it...  it scratches more easily than you would believe.  every new album i've put on it has blanked out the entire player and made me have to format it and resync my entire library.  it holds nothing like 1gb of songs. more like 900 mb. it records so quietly you can hardly hear it.  the earbuds hardly work.   i would not buy this again, given 70 bucks. i would go for a completely different brand, different model. and next time i won't be fooled by 4 glowing reviews.   
it's okay, but i didn't like having to record songs for playback. i really wanted to be mobile and still have the live radio.  
this video unit very swiftly followed on the heels of the photo ipod which clearly was aimed at maximising sales for folks who wanted to put digital photos/power point presentations etc on an ipod, presenting them with another three-four hundred photo/video unit after they'd just bought a threee-four hundred dollar unit. after barely three months the photo ipod is now effectively discontinued and being discounted. i initially got a 60 gb photo which i discovered is incompatible - its just too thick for the docking station -  with the new altec lansing im 7 - after establishing said incompatibility with apple (obviously altec's fault - not apple's) i discovered that the new 60gb (slightly thinner) video was just about to be launched so i swapped my photo for a video only to discover apples cynical exploitation continues. i was very unimpressed with the video ipod, the screen would have scratched very quickly and does according to many reviews, unlike the photo which happily is more durable, there was no mains adapter, none of the peripherals i have like italk work, you have to buy the new universal dock at fourty dollars a pop to make some features work. the better (20 hours) battery life is only for the 60gb, another deliberate cynical ploy. the video/battery capability is seemingly  pretty limited as regards watching films longer than 100 mins or so. i dont really see the point of watching vacuous mtveee type music videos on such a small unit - but each to their own. as for the limited tv series drivel currently on the itunes ppv web site, enoough said!!   i originally had a 4th gen 40gb which was big enough for my 5000+ songs. each time they update the ipod they take something away from the package. this time with the video they've taken virtually everything away, no dock, no adapter, no peripherals, and added the crappiest thinnest case you could imagine which wont really protect the unit long term. unless very small screen video is really tremendously important to you and you're happy spending two dollars on each music video/populist tv shows thus far offered buy the photo ipod and save fifty dollars and get a much better deal with a screen that will not scratch so easily and wont be such a problem even if it does scratch up a bit. i use mine exclusively as a music/audio player and now have a second photo ipod after swapping out my new vidoe player. i found the video player took thirty mins or so longer to download the exact same number of songs that my photo ipods took.  and i can still record speech/memos etc on my ipod, use an fm transmitter on the car stereo. its funny how generally speaking the media just lap up whatever apple do and never seem to criticise the (to me) cynical plethora of products, many of which if you have a reasonable music collection are worthless, 1gb or less of music recorded at at least 192kbs to ensure reasonable play back sound is to me a waste of money and effort. if you buy decent headphones - at the very least shure e3's or better, owning a 60 gb ipod is an expensive toy. doubtless apple will sooner or later launch yet another expensive video ipod update, presumably enough folks will want the kudos of having the latest model so apple's profits will continue. hopefully if this cynical product exploitation continues increasingly folks will begin to see through this creeping corporate cynicism. i make this observation as a free market loving republican. i suppose as a proud non gamer and older geezer, with nothing but contempt for the vacuous mtveee and its ilk this product is not really aimed at me.  my music ipod is still by far and away the finest and most cherished toy i have ever owned.   
yeah it's cool but.....their customer service sucks!!!! my iriver's battery doesn't last long at all. i tried calling their phone number twice. both times i hung up after thirty minutes of no end in sight extremely frustrated. the only way to reach them is through email it seems, so that's a couple of weeks wait.   which is ridiculous for a device that cost $200.  i'm regretting not getting an ipod. (which is quite hilarious because i got an iriver thinking it would be better than an ipod.)  
the macvision mp3 player,model ma833a is smaller than most candy bars, but works great.  the 128 mb version will store over 8 hours of audio and in a pinch can be used to transfer computer data files as well.  the stereo sound is good and the user can easily switch from one recorded file to another.  it's a terriffic value for the price.  
if this was 2002, i'd say "go for it", but today... i must say "don't bother" -- this thing is small and thin, but the interface sucks, and is waaaay out of date. not to mention 256 megs is nothing in today's world. get an ipod or a comperable mp3 player that is more current technology. this thing deserves to have "hello kitty" stickers placed on it, and be marketed to kids.   
i had some concerns proir to purchasing this after reading reviews on the amazon, newegg and other websites.  it appears you've got a 50-50 chance of getting a good one.  i took a chance and got the lemon.  i lost all confidence when i finally got though to the rca techies, and their response was "yeah, these have issues, not really sure why".    having to carry around a toothpick to reboot this everytime it freezes is not my idea of a quality product.  not that i use this often, maybe an hour a day, if that but when the backlight gave out, it was time to send back.  kudos to amazon's return policy and i'll take the refund to purchase something else.      
a disclaimer:  the sheer gloriousness of this little player earned it the two stars, which is remarkable considering it broke.  i can't imagine how popular this is gonna be if they ever get it right.  this is a gorgeous little player, easy interface, great color screen, rich beautiful sound and works with windows media player.  however, i got the first one this past saturday, used it for 2 hours....saturday night it just wouldn't work at all, no matter what i did it wouldn't turn on, i did everything the troubleshooting guide told me to.  so i returned it sunday morning for a new one.  it worked beautifully sunday evening...played it for about an hour.  monday evening, i left the house, got in the car, tried to turn it on..same problem, just refused to turn on no matter what i did.  it's really a shame too, because i just adored it, it was so cute and sounded excellent, and i got photos on it and everything, and it was the size of a zippo lighter.  for 3 hours, i was the envy of my friends.  i returned it monday for the clunkier but seemingly more solid zen micro, and so far so good, but after reading some reviews i'm not too hopeful about that one either.  if this one messes up, i just may scrap the whole idea of ultra-portable music and stick to cd's.  i would suggest you wait two years to buy an mp3 player...wait till they've figured out how to make ones that work right.  
this is my second archos that i've had and i feel that it needs to be more durable for all the money you shove out to get it. my first one fell out my locker and i definitely accept responsibility for that, but this second one i've bought takes the cake. at first, it was doing fine. no issues. but now, it has shut down and it won't start back up. i went to the site and tried to reset it like the instructions said but that didn't work. so, i sent an email to the archos site and now i'm awaiting a response. i think i've finally learned my lesson. all that glitters is not gold!!! beware buyer, unless you are the type that don't mine spending money or super careful of all your stuff.  
i bought this device because i needed a usb key (it claims 2 gb) and wanted to listen to mp3's and fm radio also.  not only does it not function as a usb key (some reviews have indicated that one can download new firmware to make it do that, but how many users have the skill or persistence to do that?) but my computer (dell optiplex 745) does not recognize it at all (thus windows media player 10 cannot synchronize to it). bottom line: i have a very expensive and not very good miniature fm radio.  
i love my little zen. i've had mine for about 4 months now and am incredibly happy with it. its so small and convenient. i'm subscribed to napster's "to go" service and it works seamlessly with that. i dont travel a whole lot but occasionally i'll take a 2 or 3 hour bus ride and my zen makes it go so much faster. i use it mainly for when i work out. its perfect because it so small i just carry it in my hand while running. the headphones included are not so good but i have a pair of sonys that have lasted me years now that i use. the greatest thing about it was that i accidentally left it in the pocket of a pair of jeans and then put the jeans through the wash. the little guy survived an entire wash cycle and still works perfectly. imagine that! i did let it dry out on the window sill for a week before turning it on.... but i didnt think it would still work. zen, i love you!  
i bought this player because i needed a small fm radio to listen while at work. the tuner works fine but not perfect. it picks up reception from the headphone cord which is the reason for the so-so reception.  i like that the player connects and charges through a standard usb plug instead of a mini-usb socket that needs a small usb cable to use. the player recharges fine with any wall charger with a usb port. the cover for the usb plug fits firmly and blends with the rest of the player.   i also like the style of the oled screen. there is a microphone and an option to record a fm station, but i never use those options.   my major problem with this player is that it resets all of its settings and preset fm stations randomly. sometimes the player will be stable for a week, and sometimes the player will reset 1 or 2 times in a day. it's very frustrating to search and preset all of my favorite stations after a random reset.  another problem i have is that the "play all" option for mp3 music automatically sorts the songs by the reverse order that they were loaded into the player. this makes for a tedious time loading up multiple parts of a podcast in correct order to the player.   an obscure problem that i ran into was that it makes winamp crash while it was plugged into one of the computer's usb socket. deleting a file in winamp that syncs it to mp3 players solves that problem.  the player claims to have 15 hours on a full battery recharge. the most time that i'm used the player on one fully-charged battery is about 11 hours.  this player had great potential to be a great mp3 player, but too many problems had ruined that opportunity. overall, if i had a second chance, i would not buy this player again.   
just like one of the previous user/buyer mentioned, it looked complicated but was really an excellent device once you get to figure out how it really works...my only problem now is how to record tv shows directly to this device and i would have given it a 5 stars then...i have to add that customer service did a good job when i needed assistance too...  
after being an ipod owner for the last two years, i was in the market for a second ipod. i slept on the ipod mini and i'm glad because now there's the ipod mini. i love it. i was worried that it'd be a total drag to set up but it was perfectly compatible with all my previous itunes stuff. i didn't have to even load the included cd all i did was downlaod the latest verisons of the ipod updater and i made sure that i had the latest upgrade of itunes.  the nano works with all my previous cables for my 3rd generation ipod. so after i removed it from the package i plugged it in my previous ipod's ac adapter. the one draw back is the nano does not include an ac adapter but you can still charge it with the usb cable. i was able to get a full charge in about an hour with the ac adapter. with that said, i highly reccomend this amazing mp3 player. it exceeded my expectations. the ease of use, the design, everything is wonderful. now you may think...why spend money on an mp3 player that only holds 500 songs? well, how many people do you know that have time to listen to 5000 songs everyday? i can manage my playlists. i control what's being fed into my ipod and i like that. this is a great 2nd ipod for current ipod owners and a treat to first time buyers.   
do not buy this product!  ignore the 5-star rating - that's from a few months ago.  immediately after receiving this, i wrote a great review when it was working...  however, once the warranty ran out, the product stopped working!  with fresh new batteries, the player will not even turn on anymore - the screen flashes the logo and starts to turn on then shuts off after a split second.  occasionally if i hold the power button for about 10 minutes, it will finally turn on, but then if i'm listening to music and go to adjust the volume or skip to another song - any button i touch, turns it off and then it will not turn back on.  of course since companies don't care about the customer anymore, most companies, including creative, don't back their product after 90 days, which turns out to be about the life span of this product.  if you don't mind paying $70 for a disposable mp3 player that will only last three months, go ahead, but if you are looking for something that will last longer than three months, look elsewhere.  
got this as a gift for my girl friend.  she is very pleased with it.  she has had it for about 18 months now, uses it every day, and it works as well as the day she got it.  
i got this as a gift from my wife just this past christmas. it completely died mid-song while i was walking to the supermarket. and that was only the fourth or fifth time that i used it. caveat emptor.   
my wife uses her rio carbon all the time and she loves it.                                                     b. holmes  
the device worked well and was a joy to use. for about two months. it then refused to turn on. i had to send it back to archos. about a month later i receive a replacement. the replacement had a shoddy d-pad and couldn't recharge. obviously nobody even checked to see if it worked before sending it to me. had to send it back. it's been about 5 weeks so far and i have to keep calling, listening to some lady who only works there 2 days a week complain about all the problems they have with the warehouse. i regret this purchase more than anything i've ever bought.  
i was very excited to own this product. but when the setup turned into a laborsome 7 hour ordeal, i began to wonder why i had spent all that money for something that should be a piece of cake. oh yes, and don't forget about the big hooplah that you have to go through to download, transfer, and eventually find out it doesn't use all the different formats that music is available to us. great concept microsoft, but the typical consumer doesn't have time to jump through hoops and tame lions just to listen to music or watch videos. i returned it.   
the creative zen nano plus 1gb is a relatively cheap no-frills player in a market space crowded with expensive more fully featured devices.  - uses batteries, avoiding issues/problems with recharging  - relatively easy to download music files to using windows media player - excellent sound quality  a very nice, handy entry-level player i would recommend to anyone.     
i just bought one not too long ago, but was not satisfy with it, although the design is by far the best among all the mp3 players out there, but in term of function wise, it is a totally different story. had to return it and bought the creative zen micro which allows me to put music files into the gadget through windows explorer or windows media player. in addition, it allows data storage as well which ipod mini lacks, and data storage has a maximum of 4gb which i am very impressed. it also came with an extra removable battery and best of all, i can update the firmware myself w/o having to goto apple personally to update the gadget.  
i'm a bike rider.  now i can put in my ear buds, put my mp3 player in my pocket and ride for hours without changing tapes or cd's.  the sound quality is equal to sitting in the theater.  thanks creative.  
it was a gift for my nephew, 17yrs. old. so far he seems to love the whole thing. he says it holds more than enough music, its controls were very easy to learn and use. i would recommend this product/item to everyone who has a teenager as well as everyone who loves music at their fingertips in an mp3 player.  
hdd read error when opened the box. i searched the internet and found it hapened to many others (i made a mistake not searching about the prodcut before purchase). no resolution was suggested. i packed it back and shipped it for refund.  
one of my friend got this coby 1gb mp3 player, the package and the player did say that it is a 1 gb player. but in the system it showed the total capacity as 459 mb. everyone knows that the capacity displayed is little less but not as much as >500 mb. we tried formatting the drive and making it fresh, but of no use. there are no cds, softwares, tools provided to diagnose the player. i guess coby has used some compression to show 512mb as 1gb during factory install.  we tried calling up the number in the package which said "call this number before considering returning the product" !! the person on the other side could not understand our problem, he kept telling us (threatening) about where we got our mp3s, drm stuff. crazy !! seems like he was reading from the papers provided to him. useless customer service. they said it, we returned the product that very moment.  do not buy anything coby. there are better mp3 players that are worth the buck you pay for.  
got product, powered on, no display visable. the sound from the fm radio was nice, but there was no display.  spoke with coby customer service, they had never heard of this problem. suggested return to amazon. wont try that brand again.  
i bought an iriver h10 20gb in nov 2005.  it froze up and required resetting within the first week.  i returned it only to receive another one just like it the next month.  neither unit ever worked when i wanted it to.  it constantly froze up and/or turned itself on (even in lock mode) only to run down the battery.  most upsetting is that i spent $270 on an mp3 player that never worked and then had to spend another $250 on an ipod this february.  good news- the ipod has never failed!  don't waste your money on iriver products.  
earphones fall apart in about 4 weeks, wire length for earphones is way too short to even place in a pocket, easily gets scratched, easily gets dented, hard to navigate, cheap menues, dont buy it or else youll regret it.  
unlike a couple of others, i have found this product to be rather undurable. i don't know what the deal is - perhaps a problem with the battery housing - but i now need to hold the thing steady in my hand while working out or else the power shuts off. also, the shuffle feature is horrible: the same sequence of songs is repeated over and over again rather than a true random sequence being generated. and as others have said, adding and changing songs on the player is slightly cumbersome. i'm now in the market for a new player.  
this is the best player on the market. it records shows wonderfully. has built in speakers so can listen back. batteries last long time(4hr video mode). can update the hard drive with a laptop hard drive to whatever size you want.the remote works wonderfully. transcodes into divx for wonderfull playback. this a item to buy!! i'm glad i got it.  
i thought i was getting a great deal considering i didn't have to pay gor the 1g jump drive(work provided). the first player i got broke within 2 weeks. the earphone jack completey fell into the player. so amazon gets me another out right away and now it's not reading the jump drive correctley. i'm gonna try to reformat it but it looks like i could be sending it back again. the company needs to do a better job with this.  
since i bought this creative media player i have nothing bad to say about it. first of all the sound quality is wonderful. sounds just as good as my stereo, maybe even better. the removable battery is cool and so easy to replace, plus placing songs in this thing is so easy. and you don't even need to load the software into your computer. all that you need in a media player. but the software that does come with it is cool. you can rip an entire cd right into it without having to go into your computer. plus you can lower the compression rating all the way down to 48 kbs. works great with napster and rhapsody...no problems.....well just one....battery lasts about 4-6 hrs on a full charge...otherwise it's great...even plays movies too...still haven't figured that one out yet...i'm just a novice so when i do you better believe i'm gonna put a movie in this thing. one other thing...there's an a/v jack so you can plug it right into your tv or vcr...which is so cool i'm speechless. can't wait for the new model which will hopefully have more gb's. 30 is just a little small for me. highly recommended. screw the ipod...get this instead...why pay 99 cents per song.   
a lot of other reviews have posted all important points, but i'll sum up with the best qualities in this player. all players have flaws in them, but it depends what you are looking for. 1) a 30 hour battery life is great if you play it a lot. plus you only need to charge it for 2-3 hours to get it fully charged 2) the sound quality is superb for an mp3 player, with its own equalisers, custom and pre-set. you can set your own treble and bass quality. 3) lots of shuffle options. you can shuffle by groups, singers, albums, and songs (basically track shuffle and unit shuffle). 4) you can't exactly have playlists but you can 'bookmark' up to 100 songs, which acts like a playlist. 5) you can search by artist, groups, genre and album 6) the player is very very small (smaller than an i-pod) and can hold up to 13,000 tracks. it is really thin and can easily slip into a shirt pocket. 7) lots of useful little things that makes the player great, such as a measure bar to indicate how much time of one song has elapsed.  
it's really unstable and unreliable from my experience with it. when i first got it, i really liked it. it was rather easy to use and the sound quality was more than i could ask for. didn't use the head buds it came with, i prefer large bulky headphones. :d i got it as a christmas present from my parents, specifically for i trip i was taking to work on a project. i would be needing it because i was making makeshift desks and my computer was no longer an adequate mp3 player anymore. not exactly portable. this would be my first portable mp3 player.  i was a little suspicious of the touch...button---light things at first, but they grew on me because it could brush on the floor and it wouldn't be effected. i could care less about fancy interfaces or how it looks, just as long as it works. i wanted it for one thing and one thing only, to use it as an mp3 player. and for a time, it was good. it worked, with a small complaint about how long it took to transfer files. but that was no biggie, at the time i only had 2,000 songs. it only took a few hours...  but then one day i pause and get up to go to the bathroom and come back to find that it was frozen...the screen was on and the hardrive was dead. for a while there, i was panicking. then i went to the ridiculously-over-the-top faq and found out how to reset it. i thought my problems were over, i was liking it a little less though, but heck, it was a minor bug and i thought that would be the end of it.  how very wrong i was.   after that i had no problems for a while. it was working and i was very happy with it. it was somewhat reliable, although i couldn't figure out how to do the playlists. (i was liking having the one it came with) and i didn't want to use windows media player, the program is a little on the evil side. it worked just fine with dragging the files via windows explorer.  one day, i turn it on, and the list of songs is empty. there's nothing....i panic. i plug it into the computer and discover that all the songs are still there, mysteriously though they do not show up on the device. i do what i've done before, i get rid of all the songs and start again. i finally give in and see if "syncing" is any faster. it was fast at first, then it slowed down, then it stopped completely, then (big surprise :o) the program crashes. thanks a lot wmp. t_t  my collection has grown...a bit since then, too. so now i'm stuck with an empty unreliable buggy mp3 player. looks like my computer is currently my main jukebox.  overall nice concept. i don't care for fancified things, i like it when they work, but this machine is unfortunately style over substance.  they should have worked out the very apparent bugs before releasing it. they were in such a hurry to release the windows answer to the ipod, which in itself sounds like something worrisome.  i give it two stars. easy to use and rather nice...when its working. usually it isn't.  
like other reviewers, i found this item frustrating.  the item would turn itself off, and then hardly turn itself on.  i thought that maybe something was the matter with the battery that it came with, but when i changed the battery, it wouldn't work at all!  after fiddling with it awhile, i found that the battery doesn't fit snugly in the battery compartment, so it comes loose and turns off.  i liked the price, and the fact that it was a good started player for my younger children, but it didn't even hold up under normal usage.  
for me and others the rio 600 was a long awaited electronic device.  sadly my first rio was a dud.  it cracked and poped and sped up and slowed down unexpectedly.  it also thought every song was under a minute and half even  though it was not.  after playing just a small part of the song it would go  onto the next song even though the first one wasn't done.  example: the  player says the song lasts 3:44 it ends at only 1:30 into the song.  i then  spent an hour talking with diamond over the phone and they told me it was a  dud. so i took it back after working with it for 5 hours.  the new one acts  the same way so i tried it on another computer and it plays the whole song  now but it still sounds like rice crispies.  the usb port is squirly and  causes the songs to have big glitches but the computer version of the mp3  has no problems the computer version should be identical to the rios  version.  this prouduct is just begging for a recall.  be smart don't  invest in a rio till this one gets a recall.  
i use this with my imac and it works perfectly. the itunes software does everything for me and it's great. the new one has support for podcasting and photos from digital cameras with iphoto. it also shows the image of the cd cover if you got the song from the itunes music store (also easy!) i learned how to do everything in seconds! it's great not only for people who know a lot about computer but also for beginners.  
i purchased this mp3 player because i wanted something tiny, without an internal battery to fail, and inexpensive in march 2005.  i still have it, and have used it about 20-40 hours per week, almost every week since i've had it, and it is still going strong.  i love it, the aaa battery lasts about 15-20 hours, and its easy to keep spares on hand-instead of having to worry about recharging the whole unit. i have a pc, and changing around files is a breeze. the rubber case it came with clips easily to waistband, belt, neckline, wherever you want it to go, and then you can forget about it-its not huge and bulky like certain other players (ahem, ipod).   i highly recommend it. over the last 15 months, it's been every where with me-art studio (had a near miss with paint, one day) working out, locked in the car in a hot texas summer, and dropped too many times to count, and it both works and looks as good as the day it arrived.  
file transfer rate is at least five times slower than equivalently-priced sansa m240. muvo v100 is full-speed (actually usb 1.1) not hi-speed (true usb 2.0). at creative's site there are three pages of customer complaints about the muvo v100 slow file transfer rate. no fix is currently available, though creative customer service sends customers on a firmware-download wild goose chase and neglects to mention that the snail-like transfer rate is a well-documented problem. also, the player's wheel, which needs to be turned and pushed, is an annoying gimmick. finally, sound for playing audio books is indifferent. stick to sansa, the only problem with which, if you lose your place in an audio book, is a slow fast forward.   
sonicblue rio s35s sport physical construction is ergonomic, nice looking and appears to be rugged. exterior, made of a &quot;rubbery&quot; material, has a good feel and allows for a good grip when holding the unit. lighted display is excellent and fairly easy to navigate through the menus. joggers will have to stop and navigate through the menus to switch from player to radio (or vice vera) since there is no radio/player hardware button. sound of audio player is decent.<p>unfortunately, radio reception is poor. earphone wires which serves as the antenna is sensitive to movement and the position of the device. s35s has a bass/treble equalizer but loses its settings in radio mode once the unit is turned off. unit does not have much bass. when s35s is turned on, you may experience distortion for a few seconds, depending on settings. when unit is turned off in radio mode at a low volume setting, there is an annoying power/volume surge.<p>people considering purchasing the s35s will want this product because of its small size, nice exterior features and expandable player capabilities but will pass if an fm radio is important.  
i got this for 19.99, since it was cheap it bought it...  first day test try: it was fine second day: there's couple of white lines show up on the screen...ok... third day: the player keep auto turn off for no reason at all!!   also...it eats the battery life..last me only around 4 hours..continuous playing it.  as the saying goes...there's a reason why it's so cheap... >.&lt;  
this isn't going to be long and boring because everything good/bad has been said so far. good - size, flash memory, photo ability, etc..  bad - i got black and it scratches very easily! i only had it 2 days and from carrying it in my pocket, the front looks very scratched like i had it a few years already.  also, don't know why they put the headphone jack on the bottom ... and so far there's no belt clip for this.  only a lanyard headphone or an armband.  i need a belt clip for the gym.  anyway, the sound ...  i only listen to my players cranked!  every mp3 player i've ever bought, including my previous 3 ipods, i listen to at full volume.  so, just to test, i got my 6 gb ipod mini and put it side by side with my new nano.  i started "walk" by pantera simultaneously on both players and took my best pair of headphones going back and forth from one player to the other.  well, the new nano blew away my 6 gb ipod!  noticeably louder, deeper bass, and my favorite, much sharper and higher treble!  i hate to admit it, but it makes my 6 gb mini sound like crap. (hello ebay!) i can't comment on the battery life yet at that volume, but i'm sure it will be much shorter than the 14 hours they say.  but if you buy this player for no other reason ... buy it for the sound!  
i love this player. the sound is fantastic and the convenience of having to use only one aaa battery is one of the main features that prompted me to purchase one.  however, i am dismayed by how fragile the battery cover tab is. even hough i was careful, the little notch on the tab keeping the cover in place wore out quickly and then the tab broke off. this all happened within 9 months. when i called creative lab's support center about this, they offered to sell me a new one. it would cost me $5 for the cover and $11 shipping to canada or $7 to my us address! that just seems quite steep to mail such a tiny piece of plastic. i'm not in the habit of throwing my money around like that and would rather invest the $12 - $16 towards a new mp3 player.  luckily, i always use the rubber cover so the battery cover stys in place. i would have given this player a perfect 5 stars if it wasn't for that infamous battery cover.  
although i love the size and plug-and-play simplicity of this player, i can't stand the way it works.  a perky customer support person at creative told me that it was not designed to support "playlists."  what that means is that you cannot control the order in which songs are played.  so, if you are making a workout mix, you can't put the fast songs first and then cool down songs.  you can't listen to albums in their entirety or intended order.  you can't control anything about the playback experience.  so if you don't mind having hayden and hendrix mixed together, this is the player for you.  but if you want to experience music how the artists intended to be experienced, or how you intended when you made the mix, then steer clear of this one.  you will either be disappointed, or very frustrated as you change all the song names in your music library to "a" "b" "c" so that it will play as you want it to.  bummer.  
i very much like this product because battery life is good, very easy to transfer songs and easy to navigate.  
i actually have never owned an mp3 player until now, so i don't have much to compare the creative with. but i can tell you it's great to have a small tool that can do so many things. the radio reception is fuzzy at times and the battery life is pretty bad with the wrong batteries, but overall it has a great set up with helpful file folders to organize, great recording capabilities, plug and play option if you don't want to install the cd on every computer you use it on, and so many ways to connect it to your computer and other hardware.  if you're not looking to break the bank purchasing a quality mp3 player then forget about ipod and go with creative. (btw: my player was red not black, but i'm sure the black one's just as high quality)  
with the capacity to hold 5,000 songs or 20,000 photos, or any combination of the two, i don't know if i will ever be able to use all the memory i have available to me.  
i bought this as an xmas present to myself.  the &quot;first&quot; one i received had a huge scratch across the screen.  i thought i would be able to put up with it, but it was just ridiculous so i setup a exchange thru amazon (which i must say was the best part of my experience thus far.)  the ups guy was there the next morning to pick it up, and my replacement was there the following day.  so far, i was ok with the situation, these things happened, and i hadnt ever had a problem with amazon in the past so i figured, what the hay.  then the second one came and it also had a scratch on the screen.  much smaller, but still obviously scratched.  i had just chosen to &quot;deal with it&quot;.  then it started having the same problem another person mentioned in their review, it would not power up. i charged it till it was full, but it wouldn't power back up.  i had to plug it in to get any power and then after about 20 minutes or so, if i would turn it off, it would not turn back on.  &quot;screw it&quot; i said.  and i setup another return for a refund this time, not a replacement. i still think this is a good product and from all the other reviews i've read, it looks like my issues were just flukes.  but im gonna take out the only variable in question and just go buy it at a retail store. that way i will be sure to avoid any cosmetic defects and i suppose i'll take my chances with the whole battery issue. wish me luck!  
it's cool and small  
as of yesterday morning, the charger no longer appears to be charging the screen. the unit was working fine and it died without any special mistreatment at the time it died. i used it to listen to music on airplanes and kept it in my backbpack, so it got some shaking and suck, but it wasn't especially abused.   
i never had to use customer support, that's why it gets four stars. wow i have owned this wonderful toy for a year never had a problem with. i have dropped it! it rebooted and rebuilt the library. it does so much. records, records your favorite radio programs too. (think felix hernandez) keeps data and photos (no video) create play lists whatever suits your mood. it's like walking around with your own theme music. an equalizer, choose your list random or planned. play all or play some. adjust the volume. oh and another thing get your own headphones. creative gives you an excellent product then gives you really cheap ear phones. but if your thinking of buying this at 8gb think twice and get more than 3 times as much space for the same price.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b000ea8u12/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2853325-4004715">creative zen sleek photo 20 gb multimedia player (aluminum/white)</a> same price but get more, more more! a  little larger, same functions but at 20gb you'll lose your mind and make extensive use of amazon's very varied music library.  
this is a good product, but the install process can be a mess (check the sandisk forums, and you'll see there are a lot of people struggling). i have an xp machine and am computer savvy, but it took me 3 hours to get my computer to recognize this player and two frustrating and very unproductive tech support calls (they tried, but they ran me around in dead-end circles that did not make much sense). i *finally* got it to work by reading a random non-sandisk website that said to turn the player to on, slide the bar to "hold," and then press the center button while plugging the device into your usb port. for some weird reason, that did the trick, even though never suggested by tech support. so, watch out, but if you can get it to install, it's a good deal.   
this thing worked for two days and then started cutting off songs and starting them over.  we thought it was the battery going bad but a new battery didn't help.  don't buy this item.  i am not even going to bother getting it replaced after reading the other reviews here.  
i really enjoyed running and going to the pool with my previous bean that had the same 1gb storage.  it fits perfectly in my hand and never gave me any trouble until i dropped really hard on the concrete, which was all my fault.  i had, had it forever and missed it so much that i ordered the same one, but in a new color.  i have found it easy to use and copy music onto.  i would definitely recommend the bean!  
physically attractive, with many interesting features, the zen suffers from serious limitations.  most significant, the documentation is grossly inadequate and fails to set forth how to utilize many of the most important features. for example, nowhere is it seen that in order to enable the resume feature when listening to an audio book, you have to shut down the unit. and nowhere does it indicate how to shut down the unit. scrolling ahead and back is also a problem. if not done very carefully, the unit freezes and must be rebooted. the earphone  connection is poor, often requiring jiggling to restore sound in both ears. the ipod is a far superior unit. the only advantage of the zen is its ability to use items downloaded from the public library. the zen is a major disappointment.  
i was pretty excited about this player, having read about it in runners' world. there are a lot of problems with it, however. while it is advertised as a sports mp3 player, in a lot of respects it isn't very convenient for someone who buys it for sports. my issues are: - headphones are not at all appropriate for sports, particularly running.. they keep falling off, so i had to invest in a better pair of headphones. kind of weird since it's supposed to be a sports player. also, i spent at least five minutes everytime untangling them before i could use them. - hard to change music while running, and it often ends up doing something i don't want it to. you can't change the music without removing the mp3 player from the armband, which is a major pain and is just a function of bad design that you can't tell from any picture. - not easy to figure out the features of the player, such as the stopwatch, pedometer. also hard to use once you do figure it out. - software is a pain to use. - organization of songs is annoying and difficult to maneuever on player.  that being said, i still use it. there are some good features: - long battery life, recharges super quick - very cool-looking player - very easy to carry around.. can slip it a pocket or a bag of any size.   i would not recommend this player and if given a choice, i would not buy it again.   
i recently purchased this product and expected a lot from it. the overall design is sleek and the advertised features impressed me. while the price tag is a bit steep, i nevertheless forked out the cash. to my surprised i was very disappointed by its performance. the usb cable was flimsy and didn't seem to fit my player properly, my computer would not recognize the device. i was forced to use an extra usb cable i had. while the music transfer was a breeze, my player began to get extremely hot in minutes. and froze on several occasions. while this might merely be one time malfunction, nonetheless for the 250 dollars i paid i expected a lot more. i would not recommend this product.  
i've had my dell dj for over 2 years now. in all that time it's only locked up on me three times which was easily remedied by resetting. i've still got a long way to go to fill up the hard drive, it's about 9gb full and i've got all the songs i'll ever need to listen to. i don't use musicmatch to transfer songs over. i don't think the application is all that great. i use realplayer instead and it works like a charm. it's literally drag and drop from my hard drive to my player. for considerably less money than an ipod, which by the way is not without some very negative reviews, i've been very pleased with my purchase.   
this is the second one of these i have purchased.  i got one for my wife for the gym, and fell in love with it.  very easy to use, nicely integrated software, allows me to totally control what's recorded.  highly recommended.  
i purchased this item for myself with my christmas bonus.  my brother turned me on to archos a while ago.  he bought his wife a unit that just displays pics and plays music.  while exploring their site i came across the av700 and realized that this was the one for me!!  since it's more costly, i've waited til now to purchase - it was soooo worth the wait!!  i love this thing!!  i've downloaded movies, music, pics and also dvr'd tv shows & movies.  i use mine mostly to watch stuff and you can easily view your downloads or dvr's on the screen.  the initial set-up of the different downloads (music, pics, movies, dvr) is not the best, takes a few times of going over the directions (which are minimal at best) to get the hang of it.  but once you've mastered them, it's very simple.  also, it was great that it came with all the accessories needed.  my husband was so impressed with mine, that he had me go back online and order up one for him!!    
now that i have the mp3 player, i am satisfied with it, but i am not satisfied with amazon; the reason being that the unit i bought from amazon, according to the info on their site, also included an fm tuner, and what was sent to me, did not. rather than go thru a hassle, i opted to keep the unit, but i doubt that i will deal with amazon again.  
how to make rca lyra rd2765 be recognized as mtp player and installed as napster to go device.  there are 2 settings you should check:  1) be sure that your protocol is set to mtp (microsoft transport protocol) to insure that your device will work with n2g.   2) the correct mtp driver must be installed by windows xp. if not, it will only be recognized as a usb mass storage device.  there are 2 protocols in this device: mtp & msc.  you can switch between mtp & msc if you are a windows xp user. unfortunately, old windows o/s users like win98 cannot make this switch. it will be fixed to msc.  how to switch from mtp to msc and vice versa.  1. from the settings menu, rotate the control ring to select advanced.  2. push the control joystick to the right to view advanced options.  3. the current protocol will be displayed.  4. press the control joystick to switch be tween mtp and msc.  5. push the control joystick to the left to return to the previous submenu, or press the m button to exit the menu.    more information on mtp & msc:  why do i want to use mtp (media transfer protocol) mode?  mtp mode is essential if you want to transfer drm content to your lyra jukebox. today mtp mode is only supported in windows xp and through windows media player 10.0 or other special software provided by your music service provider. in mtp mode you lyra jukebox will no longer show up as a drive letter. so programs that were designed to work with a device that shows up as a drive letter will not be able to work directly with the lyra jukebox.  why do i want to use msc (mass storage class) mode?  if you are using windows 98se, me or 2000 you can not use mtp mode only msc mode is available. your lyra jukebox will always show up as a msc device.  if you are using windows xp your lyra jukebox will show up as a mtp device, but we have provide you the option to be able to switch it to msc mode with a setting in the advanced options section of the lyra jukebox. once this setting is set to msc mode every time you connect the device to the pc it will show up as a drive letter and allow you to use any software that can work with msc mode. this will also allow the current version of lyradj or any other playlist editing program to find the device.  all supported content put on the device in either mode mtp or msc will be available to play on the device once it is disconnected from the pc. so you could add mp3 files in the  msc mode then run lyradj, profile the device and disconnect it. then switch it to mtp mode and reconnect it and add drm content to it.  
don't believe the negative reviews. i've had two of them in the house for almost 6 months. no problems. they are great for downloading books on tape and music. some libraries offer free downloads that will work on this creative zen nano. they are small and easy to carry around---weigh almost nothing! email:boland7214@aol.     
initial review (april 2005) i don't like apple and neither understand nor want to participate in the ipod mania. my experience with sony walkmans (i've got two md walkmans before plus md hardware) has always been positive, and the choice of nw-hd3 was obvious.  here are my impressions:  + sound quality in incredible (i don't have the background noise some people are complaining about); + navigation is convenient; i'm able to control the device when it's in my pocket; + native mp3 playback is nice: i've got my previous collection of 300 cds encoded into mp3 because i couldn't take all of the cds with me when i moved; nw-hd3 didn't require me to decrease the already decreased quality of the music by converting mp3s into atrac.  * the battery lasts for 14-16 hours, not 30 (i'm mostly listening to atrac3plus-encoded music); * the charger is inconvenient but seems to be hard to break :) * the screen is large but long song names get scrolled just once. * sony's hd-case1 hard carrying case became available just recently; it's still hard to find. it's a must if you don't carry your hd3 in your pocket (as i do). * sony connect music store is a joke. it doesn't have what i like (various kinds of metal and rock). i downloaded a few songs from it and they seemed to be in atrac3 132 kbps - could've been atrac3plus 256 (i didn't find a way to switch the format).  - the software takes getting used to. i tried sonicstage 2.3, 3.0 and 3.1. upgrade requires you to re-authorize your player (kind of inconvenient). the latest release of sonicstage (3.1) occasinally terminates with some error. - the player sorts music by album name, not by the release year. it's a bit confusing. - the most annoying feature is that the player forgets the song that was played before charging it, and you have to look for it again.  it should be noted that i don't need some features many people find extremely useful: playlists, genres, games, organizers, etc. i know all the albums i record on my player (so far i've put 12 gigs into it), and thanks to the fast navigation i can access any of them in a matter of seconds.  buying this walkman was my conscious decision which i didn't regret.  update after 2006-01-31. the walkman freezes for 20-40 seconds every 3-4 hours, and sony suggested me to pay them $83 for figuring out what the problem is. next time i will think twice before buying their harddrive-based gadgets.  
as of this writing, no reviews are from someone who actually has one of the new ipods (10/19). that is about to change....  my 40gb ipod's hard disk had been deteriorating for a while, until it stopped working altogether. that happened to be the day before the ipod video announcement (last tuesday).   on to what you really want to know, and what you can't get from apple's website, or reviews regurgitating technical specifications:  1) can you actually enjoy watching video on a screen that small? what about the video quality?  in short, if you're holding the ipod as close to your face as you would hold an older ipod to really read what song is playing, the video quality is actually quite nice. the screen is noticeably bigger (the height is about the size of the old ipod width). if you're wondering how the quality comes out on an ipod screen (which is normally fairly pixelated), when you load a video it toggles into a mode much akin to when a computer plays a graphics intensive video game. it takes about 10 seconds for a feature-length film to load (i.e., between clicking play, and when it starts playing).  with regard to movies, the ipod doesn't support chapters. my guess is that people will eventually want movies distributed as folders, witch chapters being the individual files. this will allow chapter skipping. that said, once a movie loads, fast forwarding works very well.  i loaded a fairly graphics-intensive movie on there, at about the highest quality the ipod would allow. the actions scenes come out fine...about what you would expect for an mpge4.  2) what the heck does this thing actually look like in your hand?  it is about the size of older ipods. it is thinner (a lot thinner, if, like me you are upgrading from a non-photo gen4 40gb). the front is a flat screen, much like the ipod nano, but bigger. the clickwheel is a bit smaller than it was on older ipods, but bigger than that of a nano.   3) the screen  i have to say, the bigger screen is nice in and of itself. if you have longer track names (if you have live music, etc.) a lot more of the name will appear. this is a very nice subtlety since in oder to read a song title you don't need to wait......for....it....to.....scroll....  4) is it worth it?  jobs called this a regular ipod with "video capability." i'd say the video capabilities are a little better than that gives it credit for. i don't yet have a composite adapter, so i can't see how this comes out on a tv...  with regard to exporting video to tv, there are the following options: tv out (on/off) video signal (ntsc/pal) widescreen (on/off)  if your ipod is breaking, or is pretty old, i'd definitely upgrade. if you travel a lot or have downtime where you could hold the device pretty close to your face (train, airplane, etc.), i'd definitely get it. if you don't have much time to enjoy the video capabilities, then it probably isn't worth it.  5) firewire  the tech specs didn't say anything about firewire, so i had been wondering whether it is supported. it actually is not supported at all. in fact, i tried connecting via my old firewire cable, and the ipod brought up a screen that said something like, "firewire is not supported. please use the supplied usb cable."  6) the "case"  i saw that a case was included on the apple website...basically the case, as you might suspect, is pretty bad. i got a 60gb model, and it barely squeezes into the case. that said, cases that support the new screen will likely be unavailable for 3 weeks or so (if what happened with the nano repeats itself), and so it is ncie to have something to prevent you from scratching your new screen (which is now more important because it plays video).  anyway, i hope this answers any questions you might have. i've tried to stick to differences between this beauty and the ipod photo.  if you're still on the fence, let me say this...go for it. it is really quite nice.  
if you have old tapes and records you would like to be able to archive, put into your computer or other mp3 player, and/or burn cd copies of, this is the the portable media player/ recorder for you...but it has one major flaw*  a line in jack (odd 2.5mm, but adaptable) is a very rare thing on a portable media player/ recorder, and this has one...add to that it's vu meters and it's close to perfect for making digital copies of any audio source including your old analog recordings. that's right it actually has a line in jack and vu meters..how sweet is that? with an adapter ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b000a3gpis/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-0691807-1803628">audio adapter - rca - mini-phone stereo 3.5 mm (m)</a> ) you can jack it right in to your stereo system..with the included 2.5mm to 3.5mm cable you can jack into anything with a standard stereo 3.5mm headphone/ output jack.  recoding is encoded at 128 or 160kbps mp3..ok so it.s not high end top  notch audio, but it's just fine for cassettes,lps, 45s, radio, and yes even your old 8-track cartridges. 320 kbps would have been better, but 160 is adequate.  it also has a built in mono microphone that makes decent sounding recordings.  ..and yes it'll play your audio and video files, and display pictures too... just like everything else, bla, bla ,bla. nothing new there.  audio output is not very loud, but it does have a real user adjustable five band equalizer.  battery life is about 9-12 hrs...uh... battery..battery...where's the battery?  * the battery is not user replaceable. imho that's inexcusable. when it goes dead on you and you're away from home you're sunk. likewise when it'll no longer hold a charge. the only way to replace the battery is to literally pry the case apart or have it replaced by a technician!  as a recorder i'd give it an 8/10.  as a portable media player i'd give it 2/10 because of the battery issue alone...where it not for that i'd say 7/10.. sounds good for what it is, but i wish it had more output power.  
small, powerful and long battery life...perfect disk space.  i can workout for over 2 hours without ever worrying about dead batteries or running out of music selections.  buy this!  
this product did not work from the beginning and i sent it back and bought my son and husband sandisk mp3 players and they found them very easy to use and i plan on buying another one for my other son.   
others have described this unit fully, so i won't do so here.  highlights are: (1) about the size of a pack of gum and comes with an arm-band carrier which is great for running (2) has an fm radio and microphone built in (and a line-in jack) (3) runs on an aaa battery (my sons' ipods all died prematurely because of the rechargeable batteries which aren't replaceable)- for me it is easier to carry a few aaa batteries than a charger (4) an incredible number of settings and modes that are easy to access once you get used to the toggle-press switch (5) extremely easy to drag and drop songs into organizing folders on the pc interface (6) tiny display is amazingly informative, with song time, repeat mode, battery life, equalization setting, and song title all displayed when a song is playing (display changes when accessing other functions).  i have only one minor complaint, that is not documented: you are limited to 60 song folders (including the one or two folders that are built in).  you can set up more than that on the pc interface, but the player ignores them.    
i dont like this mp3 player because i have to put a new battery in every time i use the thing.   
it so cheap in quality almost seems like a toy. this items should be in the price range of $15.  
i bought the v plus last month, but had to return it to amazon.  i had the problem that seems to be common in several other reviews on cnet.  the software kept freezing in the middle of playback, and i could not do anything - restart song, go back, even turn the player off - without resetting, which requires a pin or paper clip.  happened several times in the first week.  my files were never deleted, but it was a pain.  i was sad, but could not justify keeping it - i don't plan to carry a safety pin in my pocket when hiking.    it is too bad, there was a lot to like about the player - the small size was great, sound was pretty good with eq adjustment and menus were easy to navigate.  i did not have much problem downloading files, and the bookmarking feature would have been nice to use since i listen to a lot of audiobooks (although i found bookmarking was not as easy to do as i thought anyway).   sorry, creative.  hope the software/hardware issues will be improved in the next generation.     
i have owned three sandisk sansa m240 models that store 1gb. the first one i purchased with a in store warranty, but the player did not work right out of the box. so i took it back and got a second sansa which developed an intermittent short within two months causing sound quality to diminish significantly. i took the second sansa back and cashed in my warranty on a third sandisk sansa m240 1gb along with buying a second in store warranty. in two months my third sandisk sansa m240 developed the same intermittent short. i'll cash in my warranty on a different player this time.  
this is the second mp3 player that i've had from philips.  the first one never worked and this one died after 5 months of use.  when you get the "flickering of death" nothing in the manual works.  my last philips product ever!!!!    
i love this little tiny mp3 player. i really have no complaints about it. the software is easy to install and user friendly. the mp3 player itself is so small and lightweight yet easy to operate, even while running. it never skips either. i loaded music on it right away when i got it and was amazed at how easy it was to convert my music files to their sony software and then the transfer was a snap. the sound is great and i am using basic headphones from a previous sony product. possibly could be better with better headsets, but who knows, the sound is plenty for your ears. i highly recommend this one. for the price you can't beat it!   
it seems that jet audio may have spammed the jet audio reviews with "quick delivery" items.  i've been waiting 2+ weeks for the cowon a2 after ordering from jet.  and getting through to customer service...grab a snickers...  update:  dec 14, 2006  well, we did finally receive the unit about 3 weeks later than expected...but at least it did arrive!    as for the a2. it's a gem.  bright, crisp screen and powerful sound output when played through car stereo.  the other reviewers have summed things up well (multi file format support is so nice).  the a2 is highly recommended...   
really happy with the zen micro.  i am using it with napster to go and have am thrilled.  the playback sound is great (with smart volume on) and it looks cool.    a few gripes: - as a previous reviewer stated, the battery life was short at first, but after a couple full discharges - i'm getting at least 10 hours of music per charge. - the touchpad is way too sensitive!  i have to lock it when i do not want to use the controls (and its on low sensitivity). - no accessories.  i can't find a holster/clip for this thing for use when exercising.  you'd think there would be tons out there....go figure. - creative media software is marginal. - it's the same toilet-white as an ipod on the sides and back.  all things being equal, i'd buy it again.  
this player is small and fits in my pocket.   the sound is really good (althougth i prefer using my own headphones because the ones that come with it are not very comfortable).  operating the menu is a little difficult (it is a wheel) and sometimes you get in the wrong place because you didn't turn it just right.    battery life seems to be pretty good.  overall, i am happy to have a player, so i am happy with it.   
i've owned this rio carbon for about two years. the interface with various windows versions (i've gone through several since buying this) is very poor, the actual software program that comes with this rio is rudimentary and that is almost a compliment. the unit itself is prone to fits of all kinds including restarting without reason, not shutting off, taking very long to turn on, etc. for any problems that you may encounter, don't count too much on the customer service. it's free only for the first 90 days and even during that time, it's pretty much useless. there is not much else that they can tell you that is not already written on their website which is meant to say, the several serious problems that this player encounters point in only one direction - it is, by nature, unreliable. avoid it! there are much better options out there these days.  
listen to the other reviews.  the proprietary sony format ia a pain and kills this for me.  i usually love sony stuff and the hardware may be good but the proprietary format conversion is too much for me.  i switched to a sandisk that works well for me.  
when i first got this mp3 player, i thought, this is going to be awesome. because i read you can connect it to your cd player, and get songs from your cds onto it. and you can, if you don't mind listening to... fffshshzzzhshhhfshhszzzz... and now your probably thinking, "then why the hell did you give it five stars?" well, the sound quality of the mp3s is amazing. and the voice recorder is so fun. which by the way, costs 30-40 dollars for apple to install, and the fm radio is great, and costs 30-40 dollars for apple to install, and you can even record a radio station for songs you like on the radio. i even fell in love with the headpones, their tiny, and very compact, with great sound. just forget the whole wma songs. a few people gave this product a bad rating because it only holds 4 hours. well that should'nt be a major problem at all, because the software is the easiest thing to use since a stand-up shower. just update it whenever you get bored of the songs. summed up, this is the smallest, most compact mp3 player (about a third the size of an ipod) with great sound.   
this is the best mp3 player ever!!  the screen is pretty big and holds alot of music and videos...has too many options to mention....but for the money, its a great buy!  
the mp3 only worked 3 days. after the third day i ignite it and it does not do anything, stays as in stanby without possibility of doing nothing.    
this is a fabulous little product.  i have an ipod which i use as my home stereo but, the samsung is what i use for my portable music player as it is durable.  whether i am jogging or in the car, i grab my samsung.  sleek, durable and &lt;$100, what more could you ask for!  
i've been using this almost daily for over 3 months now.  one of the first days i used i had it i dropped it on a hard floor and the screen went blank.  i couldn't get it back on and nearly panicked.  i took the battery out and put it back in and it came back to life!!  this has happened about 6 times since- this thing is tough!  i've dropped it several times and it just kept on playing.  it's been left in heat and cold, it's even gotten a little wet.  only thing i haven't done yet is crush it with a barbell!!  i've only used 2 batteries, which is amazing.  it took a little time to get used to the menu, but most of the time i put it on shuffle or play a whole album and it's no problem at all.  i replaced the stock earplugs immediately with soft koss earbuds- the sound is great.    as far as another reviewer complaining about the flimsy belt clip: he was right.  i left it in my car overnight in the cold, the player was fine, but when i went to put it on my waistband the plastic was brittle and snapped.  i tried gluing it with gorilla glue, snapped again.  so that night i emailed customer service.  they emailed back the next day and i was able to order replacements.  it wasn't a big deal!  it's part number 271389, costs $2.99 from rca consumer parts and accessory order center 1-800-338-0376.  i went ahead and ordered 2 so i'll have a spare.  i own a sandisk sansa too, i love it dearly but i paid too much to risk killing it at the gym.  i only paid $49 for this one, 1 gb is enough space i'm not bored with my collection yet- and i feel like i've got my money's worth out of it already!  i highly recommend this player not just for sports, but also for kids that might abuse it!  good luck!  
no complaints from this reviewer ;this is the 3rd creative product which i've purchased;the other 2 are still working good and i got this one because it's small enough to carry in my shirt pocket.  i always keep it in a plastic pouch so maybe that's helped the battery lid from breaking off.  never experienced any problem loading music or mp3 podcasts from my laptop, i just drag and drop the files into my mp3 player & works beautifully.  
i purchased the 8gb creative zen v plus player during the first week in february.  i am returning it and this is why:  the package arrived from amazon.  i loaded up the software on my computer, then hooked up the player through the usb cord.  i let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state.   then i proceeded to load some of my music onto the player.  so after the music was loaded, i disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music.  the sound quality was good, the player is easy to navigate in the menus, etc...  the problem was about half the music i uploaded was not on the player.  i could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there.  so i plugged the player back into the usb cord, and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer.  the file was there and i could play it just fine through windows media player.  i tried to access it again through the player and it was not there.  then i accessed through the computer just fine.    all my songs, all 4,500 of them, are in mp3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs i ripped from cd's.  the player just wouldn't read about half my songs.  there was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize.  i would load an entire album of 15 songs and i could only play 6 or 7 tracks.  this happened with my entire music collection.    so i thought maybe the firmware was out of date so i uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update.  it did not solve the problem.  i then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the zen v plus onto my 3 year old rio and original ipod shuffle and they played just fine.  i was frustrated at this point so i called the creative customer service.  it is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now i understand why.  they have the worst customer service/tech department of any computer/electronic company i have ever spoke with.  after three calls, never speaking to someone who i could fully understand as english was definitely not a first language, more like a 3rd or 4th language, i arrived nowhere.  they kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem.  no email ever came, checked the junk folder and every other possible place.  so i tried a fourth call.  this guy basically called me stupid from what i could understand, saying "i can't believe you americans" and then mumbled something in another language.   i asked for a supervisor. he told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2-3 days.  then he hung up.    i was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature.  they really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way.  so i am returning the creative zen v plus player and i also don't plan on buying anything from creative again.   by the way, after all this, the problem never was fixed.    also, when doing research on this product, i came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play divx files.  this is not true.  this player will not play any files without being converted first.  i took an avi video that was 100mb and it converted it into a 1.2gb file.  the format they use is absolutely a waste of space.  if you want to upload an entire movie on mpeg or avi format, it will end up taking the entire 8gb of space if not more.  i converted the movie cars for my son on a short road trip thinking i could have my music plus his movie.  i was wrong, the movie took up 7.1gb after being converted.  i would not recommend this product to anyone.  as much as i don't like the ipod, i would recommend it over the zen v plus because:  1. it plays all my music 2.  they have a customer service/tech support that helps you and cares about its customers.  i hope this helps anyone looking at this player.  jeff   
this mp3 player works great. i bought a 128mb smart media card for this and it can hold so much music now. i can get about 40 to 50 songs on here. the sound is perfect for what i need (mainly in class) and the batteries last fairly long. i personally bought rechargable batteries so i wouldn't have to worry about buying more all the time. i recharge the batteries while i sleep, just to be safe for the next long day at school. i would have opted for the dmp-120 with more memory, but i couldn't afford it. and since i got a 128mb smart media card for my birthday, i didn't miss the extra 32mb. another great thing about this is voice recording. i occasionally make notes to myself, or record parts of my professors lecture, or just the homework they assign. in any case i recommend this mp3 player for students like myself who are on a budget.  
teenagers love gadgets and this one saved the day.  we bought the sony mp3 player for christmas (we opened early) and i set up and downloaded the 5 songs that came free with the purchase of the player.  setting up the software was a snap, and downloading the free songs was easy.  moving them over to the player took less than 2 minutes and the playback was wonderful.  my son's friend has the same player, however an older version, and his headphones are not as good as my son's are.  this player has sound volume like i never imagined such a little player would have.  it's small and fits into a shirt pocket easily.  i also love that it came with all connectors and software, to include ear covers.  the music can be stored in folders or individually, which helps keep things in order.  the software also has the ability to transfer your current music into the network format, so you can have your favorite songs (legally purchased) converted over to the player.  i love it, and more importanly, my son really loves it!  
at first, i got it for christmas, and it was great, great sound and great all around. then my first problem came, i couldn't download any songs off the conect store and the support team was no help what so ever. and then a couple days ago, i dropped it on the ground maybe a 2 foot drop and it will not turn on. so know i am going to buy a new mp3, and it won't be a bean!  
this seemed like such a great idea: music that won't skip; i can record what i want. then i got it.<p>the software is far more complicated than it needs to be, and it's unbearably time-consuming to put everything you want on the machine.<p>then it there's not enough memory to record all you'll need for a long enough stretch.<p>i could go on for pages but won't waste your time with it. my last straw, however, was when, after i'd purchsed some additional memory, the lid to hold the battery in won't close. so the little, grandly over-priced toy is a total waste. <p>stick to your cd player. maybe it's not all the up-to-date, i.e., the hi-tech industry has replaced it with this little thing. but you'll enjoy it more.  
the player has what to me is a fatal flaw: when playing back recorded xm content, the player creates an automatic couple of seconds of silence between every song. this break is even more annoying because it seems to not be an inserted space (a couple of seconds of dead air if you will) added between tracks, but rather is done on top of the recording. in other words, the last few notes of every single song and the first few notes of the next song get cut off always. this is more jarring than you would imagine, especially since like most radio stations, xm's songs play back-to-back (ie: the next song is played on the station as the previous song fades away). this is the normal continuous music mix we expect from normal radio listening but the player adds a very noticeable break that cuts off the songs on both ends. this is actually even worse a problem during spoken moments like the station ids or announcements. in other words, instead of hearing "this is fred on 44", the player will instead play "is is fred on fo" cutting off the message. another example is instead of playing the well-known jingle "american top 40 with casey kasem", you only hear "rican top 40 with casey k". it is just ridiculous and ruins the entire listening experience. there seems to be no way around this flaw either. it might be less of a problem for listeners of classical or other programming that normally has silence in between each song, but for those who listen to pop or rock or dance radio, this is really terrible, as bad as if a dj totally messes up the transition between songs on the dancefloor- what we like to call a "trainwreck" of music.  
i loved the player when i bought it may.  two weeks later it failed to power on and iriver gave me an rma immediately.  they have confirmed that i will be receiving a new clix2, but there service center is backed up.  eight weeks later they still haven't sent me a new one and can't tell me when i will receive one.  i thought the player was pretty cool in may, but the new nano matches most of the features and you will feel much more comfortable with a warranty from an established us entity.  buy a nano!  ps the flash menus are pretty cool (especially when you can make your own)  
my sony 1gb mp3 player does a lotts working time on one aaa battery. the music is super quality, though i suggest another headphone set! connected with fm transmitter for car stereo & is great there as well. only drawback it does not play wma digital proteced rights managemet. can be corrected to play with program called tunebite works with wma sound files etc.. also could use a band or something to secure to your body mark  
my unit lasted about four days.  it performed very well until it shut down last night.  now it refuses to boot... maybe the screen is dead.  either way, it's a lemon.  after checking out reviews at other sights, this problem is not so uncommon.  i'm returning my unit today for a refund.  
i was looking to get an ipod or a comparable device for music.  i live in la and the radio here sucks!!!! i needed some music for my workout and in a device that isn't bulky like a cd player. the sony network walkman works great!  i love the sound and it is very lightweight.  i didn't buy an ipod for another $100 simply because i don't believe i need 5,000 or even 1,000 songs.  170 songs is more than sufficient for me, thank you.  this is a great deal for a great price.  
i found this accurate review of the mhj mpm 202. i then discovered i could buy it on amazon. -way to go amazon.com!  hands-on review: the nhj mpm-202 personal media player posted may 16, 2005, 2:33 pm et by barb dybwad    we had a chance to spend some time with the nhj mpm-202 portable media player. it's a 60gb pmp that doubles the capacity of its predecessor, the mpm-201, and shares most of its features. overall we found the device incredibly easy to use and great value for the price, particularly as compared to its competitors. read on for the full review.  first impressions the unit is solid. it may lack a certain sex appeal, but there is nothing flimsy or cheap about the feel of the device in your hand. the design is straightforward and intuitive: volume control scrollwheel plus play and stop buttons on the right, 4-way selector plus menu and back buttons on the left. the positioning of the controls on either side of the screen makes it easy to hold the device in both hands and control it with the thumbs. there is nothing awkward about the way the controls work - the interface is easy to use and each command does exactly what you'd expect it to do. the only disappointing aspect of the interface is the virtual keyboard entry system, which fares slightly better than the keyboard input of the psp as you don't have to be t9-ing the thing, but it's still just one of those inconvenient scroll-to-key-press-enter, repeat x15 and twelve hours later, your movie is renamed. but it's not like there are many non-keyboard-bearing devices that really make this easy. the included a/v dock is nice - it's sturdy, and it comes with separate cables whereas its main competitor, the archos av420, comes with a dock that has integrated cables that looks akin to an unwieldy octopus. the mpm-202 comes with a "record" button built into the dock, and it would be hard to imagine simplifying the process of recording new content any further than cuing up a source and pressing record. it was refreshingly dead easy. some other things we noticed right off the bat: there's a cute little kick-stand built right into the back of the unit. it means you can prop the device up on a desk to watch it, which is more handy than you realize.   the internal stereo speakers have a lot of horsepower for a portable unit. you can get some decent volume out of them with very little distortion until you're all the way at the highest setting. for listening to music, they're a bit too treble-heavy to make anyone really happy, but for watching movies they're nice because you can get away with not being tethered to headphones or external speakers. it's also handy to have slots for both cf and sd media.  features  the nhj mpm-202 is the beefier sibling of the mpm-201 - they share the same featureset, but the mpm-202 has 60gb worth of storage to the mpm-201's 30gb. it's got a 3.5-inch screen, cf type ii and sd memory slots, internal stereo speakers, tv-tuner in the dock, internal microphone (records in wav), av-output, image display (jpg), and of course, and and video recording and playback. the unit ships with a cradle and ir remote, mini to rca cable, usb cable, s-video cable, ac adapter, carrying pouch, headphones, manual, and cd-rom with music match and dr. divx video conversion software. as distributed by tightsystems in the u.s. (which, although currently in litigation with macromedia, still offers the mpm-202 through the separately owned and operated dvg store retail outlet accessible via the tightsystems website), the unit is now shipping for $449 which includes a free extra battery and free shipping.         transferring content  the nhj mpm-202 connects to windows or mac machines via usb 2.0, and shows up as a mass storage device, which means it just looks like an external hard drive connected to your machine. unless you're running windows 98 or mac os 8 (yikes!), you shouldn't have to install the drivers that come on the installation cd-rom. from there, you just drag and drop the files into their appropriate locations in the file structure of the unit's hard drive - or vice versa, if you've recorded something you want to copy to your computer. you can also transfer files from storage media to the mpm's internal hard drive. this is pretty handy for photographers, who'll be able to use this unit as portable storage. setting up the transfer is fairly straightforward in the file manager. just select a folder of images, select copy, then choose the appropriate destination. recording content  movies   pop the unit in the dock, hook up your source, and select "tv mode" from the main menu. you can choose one of three quality levels: qvga, vga, and vga fine. for playback just on the unit itself, qvga does the job admirably. for something that will be watched primarily on a tv, you'll want to go with at least vga and vga fine if you have enough space. scroll up to "video in" and select where your video source is coming from: the tv tuner, component in or s-video in.   you should then see your source show up on the mpm's screen - from here, just press the record button the dock to get going. if you're recording a bunch of things at once you can then dispense with all the setup steps and just hit the record button to start, stop button to stop. if you're recording a source for more than an hour, the mpm will automagically split your recording into multiple files; when you play them back, they'll be stitched together so you won't notice the separation (other than a tiny flicker at the moment of changeover). recording from the tv tuner is really no different. you just select "tv in" as your source and start recording the same way, by pressing the big red record button. there's a scheduling function so you can schedule recordings, and have them repeat weekly or monthly if desired. it's no substitute for a full-featured dvr, but it gets the job done if you just want to record some shows to take with you on a trip or outing. voice recorder  the voice recording function is as easy to use as the rest of the player's functions, but this is the area where the quality is not as great. recording via the internal mic results in a file with audible hiss. you can understand what's being said without a problem, but you wouldn't want to use it for anything mission critical. it's fine for recording personal memos, but breaks down pretty quickly the farther you get from the audio source - so wouldn't be terribly useful for doing things like recording lectures, e.g. this is probably why they label this "my voice" in the menu! that's about all it's good for.   playing back content  movies  to view a file on the player, just select "my movies" from the main menu and drill down into the file system to wherever your video lives, be it on the internal drive or on external media (divx-encoded avi files, only). hit ok to start playback. hit the arrow keys to fast forward or reverse at 2x, 4x or 8x speeds. you'll scrub through the video as you go, so you can see where you are and where you want to stop; just hit play to resume normal playback. hit stop to stop. hit back to go out to the most immediate file system subfolder, or menu to go all the way back out to the main menu. it's all very simple and works exactly as you would expect.   the only drawback to the interface here is there's no "bookmark" feature, so if you're in the middle of a movie and need to stop watching, you can't easily return to where you left off. you'll just have to fast forward to get back to where you were. some of the early reviews on this unit dissed on the screen quality of this player. it may be slightly smaller than the screen on the archos av420, e.g., but in terms of quality we found them pretty comparable. if you look very closely you can pick out the individual dots in the display - and that's about it. nobody will watch this unit from 2 inches away, so we can't see that it really matters. we didn't have any issues with it. playing back to an external tv does show off the pixelation of your video content more than it will on the mpm-202's screen. the quality you're going to get is going to depend on the resolution and bit rate of the original file, obviously. viewing almost anything on the smaller screen tends to gloss over differences in quality much more than viewing the same files on the big screen. still, you have the extra space to store videos encoded at higher resolutions/bit rates, so you can take advantage of that if you're going to be doing a lot of av out to an external television. as far as battery life goes, for pure video playback we got a fairly consistent three and half hours of battery life, tested over six trials with both batteries. since you get a free extra battery with the unit, that's about seven hours playback without a recharge out of the box, which'll come close to tiding you over on your next trans-atlantic, you jetsetters, you. we didn't do a test for pure audio playback alone, but expect quite a bit more playback time from a single charge.  music   the music playing interface is as dead easy to use as everything else, but it's a bit on the no frills side. the biggest downer here is there's no support for custom playlists, so if you want a particular mix of tunes you'll have to physically organize them first and move them onto the player. the other bummer is that the display skimps out on the file metadata/id tags, which seems sort of odd - the photo viewer application lets you see all kinds of crazy metadata on photos that most will probably never even care to look at, but all the info you can see about a music track is the artist and track name (and that, sporadically, which we never quite figured out)? seems weird. even if you happen to have all of your artist and track name info included in your filenames, the interface doesn't wrap the text, so you can only see the first 15 characters displayed. this also means no album art, of course, which isn't as big of a deal, but why not take advantage of having that screen?   what the interface does show is your usual transport functions: play/pause, forward/reverse and stop, and current playhead location, as well as volume and controls buttons for shuffle and repeat. hit the ok button to call up a very simple eq interface, which basically gives you +3/-3 "units" in either direction for bass and treble. pretty basic. the sound quality is pretty decent. we didn't have any complaints when listening through computer speakers, headphones, a decent stereo, or in the car. we never found the volume lacking, nor did anything sound hideously unbalanced at flat eq. whereas the internal speakers do a decent job for listening to speech and movie dialogue, for listening to music you'll definitely want to hook up some headphones or to an external speaker of some sort. for podcasts, though, the internal speakers are not too shabby - you can get away with it in a pinch if you don't want to be tethered to the headphones while listening.  images   no troubles here. as long as you organize your files the way you want them before transferring to the player, you can go slideshow nuts to your heart's content. when viewing an image, just hit the "play" button to bring up a selection of how much delay you'd like between slides (3, 5, 10, 30, and 60 seconds) and hit ok - it will keep playing continuously, with transitions, until you tell it to stop. you can view details on a photo by pressing the ok button in non-slideshow mode, or rotate it with the volume control (and save the orientation, if desired).     overall  this is a nicely-featured pmp, easy to use, and great value for 60gb of storage. the one-touch recording option on the dock is about as easy as it gets. if you're looking for a portable media player that is intuitive to operate, reliable, and well worth the ticket price, we have no qualms recommending the nhj mpm-202.  good and bad  good things:  * uses standard a/v cables that can be repurposed generally as needed, as opposed to the octopus of locked down cables that comes with the archos a/v dock. * one-button recording. * solid construction; durable casing. * compact flash and sd slots. * little foot for propping the thing up on a desk/table - really handy! * external stereo speakers, for a portable unit, are pretty good. * interface: dead easy to figure out and use. * has an av-out port right on the unit itself, so you can throw video out to a tv without needing the cradle. * 60gb of storage at a great price - lots of value in this unit.  bad things:  * file renaming interface is awkward and time-consuming. * music player has only rudimentary support for metadata. * no music playlist support. * voice recording quality is so-so. good for notes to self and recording in a pinch, but is not production-quality audio recording.  -- based on the above from bob, i just ordered one for myself. i have been looking for a pmp for several months and this is a great value.  
about six months ago i was bound and determined to buy and mp3 player.  before i purchased this player, i had had an ipod.  the sound quality on the player is very good, though, of course, the ear buds are not of the best quality; they're just your average free-with-your-purchase ear buds.  it doesn't take long to charge, but i find that sometimes it doesn't quite last as long as the twelve hours it's supposed to.  other than that, the performance of it is very good.  the h10 is also very durable; i've taken it with me everywhere without the case on and there still isn't a scratch on it.  it synchs easily with windows media player 10, and had the added feature of storing text files and pictures.  my only small complaints are that a) it isn't an audibleready device, and b) it doesn't come with any amusing little games like ipod does.  all in all, it's a great mp3 player, and i'd buy it again in a second!  
if you spend some time with this player it is equal to or better then the ipod. i've used an ipod before and its great. but when researching to choose which player i wanted to invest $300 on, i downloaded the manual from each of the players respected manufacturers (apple, sony, iriver, creative). when directly comparing the hd-3 to the ipod (the "most popular player") they both have the same annoying features. ipod uses only itunes to transfer music and sony uses sonicstage. sonicstage version 3 was pretty simple to figure out.   i loaded up my library from my pc and then transfered album by album to the hd3. it was the same procedure the ipod manual describes.      the hd3 does have a playlists option in which you bookmark songs. ipod calls it "on the go something" but both have you hold  a button to add the track to a my favorite playlist which is a few menus away from the opening screen. its no problem.   shuffling is also easy to figure out. it's about the same explanation you would see with any sony audio device. i mean the manual came from japan but its written in english. so stop whinning. the hd3 actually gives you more shuffling options than ipod. you can shuffle all the tracks, or all the albums, or all the artists, or choose to shuffle tracks within an artist or album group.   overall the hd3 has way better sound and a much longer battery life than any other player including ipod. plus if the battery dies you can replace instead of paying someone to do it. the hd3 is also smaller, sleeker, and looks cooler. plus when do sony products break? i still use a six year old cd player.  so don't let u2 convince you to buy an ipod. buy a freaking awesome player that is unique and much cooler.  no i don't work for sony, i work at publix. its a grocery store.  
its fundamentally wonderful device squeezing in lots of features in its cute n tiny shape. i didn't see any player as compact as this. only con i find is the price, probably the highest among its peers.  
after checking quite a few mp3 player reviews, i decided to buy this one, since the reviews were overwhelmingly positive and because i like its size and look. i found it very easy to install and use. i get songs from emusic and their files move easily and quickly into the player. i also used the software to encode from a cd, no sweat; both the player and the software are easy to figure out. i organize the songs into folders and change the titles ( abbreviate+ give a number to the track)to be able to locate the tracks quickly. most important to me, as the other reviewers say, it sounds great ( i encode at 220 b/s,  gladly sacrificing quantity to quality). i bought the extended warranty, just in case, but it doesn't seem flimsy. it's probably a good idea to be gentle with the buttons and battery cover, though. the radio sounds good too and catches a lot of stations, a nice addition ( just wish it had am too). the earbuds are large but sound good. the problem with the backlight making a sound must have been fixed, i didn't notice any, good, i wouldn't want to disable it, it looks cool and is useful. i'm looking forward to hours of musical pleasure with this pretty object.   
this is the new ipod but now it comes standard with a color screen. the normal ipod's now come in a standard 20 gigabyte form and the high-capacity 60 gigabyte form. the 20gb holds 5,000 songs or 20,000 photos or 15,000 songs or 25,000 photos for the 60gb. this new ipod is a little bit larger than the original though, 4.1 x 2.4 x 0.63 inch weighing 5.9 ounces. but, they have upgraded the battery life from 12 hours to 15 hours, which is nice but i would like to see an ipod with a little more life. these are the supported audio formats: aac (16 to 320 kbps), protected aac (from itunes music store), mp3 (16 to 320 kbps), mp3 vbr, audible (formats 2, 3, and 4), apple lossless, wav, aiff / frequency response: 20hz to 20,000hz. here are the supported photo display formats: syncs ipod-viewable photos in jpeg, bmp, gif, tiff, psd (mac only) and png formats. the accessories that comes with this device include: usb 2.0 and firewire 400 (with firewire cable, sold separately), composite video (with av cable, sold separately), and headphones. so all together this looks like a very good ipod. i'm probably not going to buy it though because i already have a 20gb monochrome screen ipod and i don't think i need another one with a color screen. but if you are a first time ipod buyer i would recommend this or if you need more room to store yours songs get the 60gb. it's a great deal and especially now you can't resist it (20gb ipod photo now same price as old monochrome ipod, $299.99)  
i love sony, i really do. so when i went looking for a mp3, i started with sony.  in 2005 i bought my hd3 and quickly found it to be lacking. i can't believe in the list of the features it has, "comes with an ac adapter" and "you can connect to your pc".  why, because for this type of dmp(digital music player) these features should be synonymous.  the problem is there is nothing else.  the one thing i thought would have been included was the ability to make a play-list.   and with out a play-list the "incredible battery life" is about of that when you're changing to a different artist, or albums because you turn on the back-light every time you touch the thing.  i know u can turn it off, but i don't only listen to music when it bright and sunny.  and i'm not going to change it back and forth. my friends have mp3's with swappable rechargeable lithium-ion battery, multiple play lists, built-in voice recording and fm tuner with fm recording capability.  anyway get something else and do some research if your going to spend this much money.  
i baught it and feel like throwing it from the highest floor for the following reasons;  1... like most mp3 players i have used you cannot drag and drop music files directly to the player.  2... sonicstage software used to "manage" the file transfers sucks. sony should consider firing its software writing staff, or outsource its software from good people.  3... no songs list. can only list by artist /album/genre/group/others. dude where my file list?  4... why on earth do we need another audio format (omg) ?  5... did i mention that the software sucks?  avoid till sony releases a better audio manager.  
picked this up at the local best buy, and of like most of you i was skeptical about the new unit, however i really was impressed with how it operated.. especially processor wise, very quick interface. i've had it for three weeks now and it hasn't given me one issue yet. always boots up and plays..  and by the way, this was a replacement for my samsung yh-820 that died within 6 months, that was the worst unit ever for many other reasons. i never purchase warranty plans, but you require it on these things..  
i bought this player about a month ago and i have to say it has had quite an effect on how i view entertainment.  for one thing, the mobile video has a lot more uses than you might think as you find times when you are waiting and have it on your person, you can easily watch a movie and not notice the time pass like you normally might.  the screen is definitely viewable even though it is pretty small.  people say that this player plays divx but they are being a bit misleading.  this player plays, without re-encoding a very specific formatted version of avi, which is xvid encoded mpeg4 with mp3 audio.  it does not produce ac3 surround sound output, even downmixed.  if you download a lot of movies, you may find this important to know.  however, a lot of material is pre-existing in this format.  by far the best feature of this player is the ability to use it for tv-out and the ability to make playlists on the fly.  the tv-out makes it possible to show all your friends the cool movies you have without changing formats or burning disks, etc.  another great thing about it is the usb host port, which most people don't realize not only can host a usb hard drive, but i recently discovered is a powered port (maybe this is part of the usb2.0 spec i don't know) and the power allows you to power up a set of usb speakers.  i discovered this on my own as i plugged in a set a speakers i didn't need that i got with a computer i bought recently and the speakers powered right off of the player itself.  which makes this player a great unit in a portable boombox type configuration.  with the ability to make playlists on the fly, you can completely dj a party using this unit and a set of decent usb speakers.  if you are over someone's house you could technically carry all of this around with you in your car, and in a boring moment you'd have at least a little bit of entertainment.  personally, i use this for playing music to go to sleep to at night since it fits quite nicely on my nightstand.    however, this unit does everything it's supposed to do and even a bit more with some experimenting.  the usb 2.0 host was a fantastic idea and i'm glad that they implemented it.  technically, you could probably use just about any low-power usb device as an attachment to this unit.  so all of those usb flashlights, etc. would probably work using this unit as a battery, while you are listening to music.  amazing sub-feature...  there are a couple drawbacks.  i found that the player was not very good for use in the car because you simply can't operate the interface effectively and quickly with one hand, so i use my other mp3 player in the car.  it is though, perfect in just about any other situation.  highly recommended and worth the dollar amount.  
i stopped using this product after a few weeks because of its limitations, which when added up make it a poor entertainment buy in my opinion.  no secret is made of the fact that this device only picks up the xm signal when it is tethered to its antenna and cradle... you can't get the signal on the go.  this actually isn't as bad as it might seem.  you can easily set up the device to record many hours of your favorite xm channel overnight for example and listen to it on the go later.  you can delete songs you don't like and you will eventually end up with quite a bit of music you do like.  it records xm music at a fairly low bitrate (128 kbps), which does not give you a high quality recording.  it could be that xm's signal doesn't broadcast at a higher bitrate, which would mean this limitation isn't the product's shortcoming, but rather xm's.  the user interface (a 'special' version of napster) can be extremely frustrating in terms of getting it to recognize the nexus device until you realize you have to start the software and plug in the device in a particular order, which the user manual doesn't tell you - neither did customer support at either samsung or napster.  in fact, i was told things about the device and the software that were so clearly wrong as to be sadly comical.  for instance:  napster told me the software can only manage music purchased from napster, which is clearly wrong.  the nexus manual tells you in writing that "you can only transfer songs [between the nexus and your pc] that you have purchased from xm+napster or songs that you have ripped from your audio cds."  this too is clearly wrong.    all the above in my opinion isn't even the worst of it.  this product, tied to xm radio service, can obviously be no better than xm radio itself.  i wanted very much to like xm but could not get over the fact that even though you are paying $12.95 a month, they still talk over the music, and they play plenty of ads and irritating xm 'jingles'.  i have cancelled service due to these issues.  i don't see the point for all the xm-originated chatter and channel id jingles when you can simply look at your device to see what channel you're listening to (and paying for) if you can't tell from the music selections.  i tried out xm a few years back for a few months (cancelled for other reasons) and the talk-over and extraneous jingle issues seem much worse now than they once were.  i have found internet-based sources of free music that is free of ads and chatter, and which can be recorded on your hard drive with various available software... and at higher bitrates that are of noticeably higher quality.    
this was a great little mp3 player. great sound, my wife loves the portability in the gym, but after 7 months of normal wear, the display stopped working. worse yet, i call creative and they tell me it's not under warranty anymore. they said the warranty was for 90 days!  huh? the rep at creative said they'd give me a "discount" and only charge me $45 to fix it. i asked for him to please talk with his manager about this problem. he said he'd call me back today, but i'm still waiting.   beware ... creative products look great, they sound great, but clearly they not only don't hold up well, but also don't have the type of support you expect to have from creative. sad.    
we expected this item to be at least as good as the older creative muvo tx we've had for over a year, but we were wrong. the cheap plastic on this creative nano mp3 player leads to two drawbacks we experienced within the first 3 weeks we owned it: 1) the tiny plastic clip that holds the battery cover in place easily breaks off, and it takes weeks to get a replacement cover from creative. 2) even when it's inside the plastic case (which you have to buy separately), the unit turns off, loses its settings, or forgets what song it was playing when it experiences light impact, such as dropping 3 inches onto a table.   we never had any of these problems with other mp3 players we've had for over a year.  the creative muvo tx is a much sturdier product, and it even has a better cover.  this product was a waste of my money.  it gets 2 stars because the software is very easy to use.  
i received my 4gb pink nano as a christmas present last year and so far so great!!!  i have no complaints at all.  my nano has withstood two teenage sons taking it from room to room, one 12 yr old daughter who goes horse riding listening to it and me, who takes it along to work and endures the bus ride home.  its always had a cover on it which i insist or they dont borrow it and for the longest time i kept the covering on the screen and dial but after 6 months my son removed them and still no scratches and this nano is in pockets, purses, backpacks and sometimes just lying around, its been dropped i  hate to say and still working like a charm.  we love this little gadget of technology and this christmas my 3 kids are getting their own so maybe mom can have hers back!!  i would recommend it!!!!  
this player has constant connection problems, and either the software or the player constantly freezes.  i've tried resetting the player, and that unfreezes it.. until you try to download again..  this is a headache, and i certainly wouldn't recommend it as a gift for anyone who doesn't enjoy spending hours on a computer trying to get it to work right.  
used it twice. not happy at all.<br>battery last about 3 hours, if you are lucky.<br>no bass, neither treble feature.<br>no lcd.<br>no feature to avoid music skip  track.<br>sound not as good as other mp3players.<br>the only good thing about the product is the easy you can add you songs or files (drag and drop). despite that, none.  
disregard the review below.  this unit turned into a piece of garbage just after i wrote this and it is now sitting in a landfill.  thank you govideo and rave-mp for being a horrible company!  i bought this on ebay for $160 after shipping.  my wife and i have used this mainly while working out at the gym and it would be great for people who are active and want to bring their music with them.  the sound quality isn't the best, especially with the ear-bud headphones provided, but you can mess with the equalizer so that if you get it just right, the sound is pretty good on better headphones.  the mp3 player works fine with xp and windows media player 9 or later, but the one beef i have is that it takes forever to update the library if you add or edit files on the player.  rave-mp doesn't support windows playlist features yet, but they emailed me and said that a firmware update in january would add the playlist option.  it's january 24th and i still haven't seen the firmware update, so they have a week until i start bugging them again.  this player takes absolutely forever to power up.  you hit the power button and then watch the rave mp screen for probably 15+ seconds.  it's really annoying in you're in a hurry.    i haven't needed to use the voice recorder so i haven't yet but i'm sure if i were an investigative reporter i would love it.  or if i liked to record voice memos for myself i guess.  the fm tuner is nice to have but if you want to record from the radio, the bitrate is really low so it'd only be good if you wanted to hear the name of a song or if you got lucky and won something from the radio station and wanted to record the joyous moment.  other than recording the fm tuner is great for just listening to the radio.  battery life could be better but what can you do, it's an integrated battery i guess.  battery life is around the low side of the projected life or about 8hrs i'd say.  i do wonder though how much a replacement battery would cost in a unit like this when it decides to stop charging in a few years or who-know-how-long.  all-in-all, i've enjoyed having this mp3 player.  if you have to have the best sound available, i would pass on this unit, otherwise it's pretty good and you can find it for super cheap usually on ebay.  i've seen them for as low as $130 there.  holy cheap mp3 player batman!  
the first time i used my transcend box for photo storage was on a three week trip to alaska.  the device performed perfectly and enabled me to take 700 photos with two .514 gb memory cards.  i was thrilled with it.  the second time we used the device, we took it on a trip to africa.  we brought only two memory cards with us since this method worked so well the first time.  unfortunely, the transformer died on our first day and i could not buy additional cards in africa to fit our camera.  i spent a whole vacation day tracking down a kodak shop in nairobi to transfer my pictures to cd so i could reuse my memory cards.  i have since learned that the cheap transformer plug was to blame and i have not been able to replace it with anything since.  i was told to go to radio shack but they have nothing there that can be adapted to the transcend box.  i have the choice of buying another complete transcend box with transformer (which i certainly will not do) or throwing the whole thing away.  i'm really annoyed.  
i'm pretty easy to please, but i am very disappointed in the sansa view (16gb).  one of the dumbest things i've ever done (in terms of purchases) is return a zune i got for christmas and swap it for this model.  it is easy enough to use, but it locks up a lot.  i use mine (as an mp3 player only) about 1 hour a day, and in that hour, it typically locks 3 to 5 times.  when it locks, i cannot adjust the sound or change songs for sometimes as long as 2 to 3 minutes.  this is not only inconvenient, but sometimes quite uncomfortable, particularly when it locks at higher volumes.  for $50 more, i wish i had my zune back!   
i bought the samsung 1gb about a month ago and havent put it down since! the pros: the sound quality is good, but i use other ear phones, transfering music is simple and the clear easy to read screen is great.  the only problem that i have found is how the music is sorted. i should pick the manual and read it, but its a minor inconvenience..this is definitely worth the money.  
after zen spend 2 hours constantly uploading more and more software onto my desktop, it wouldn't even let me transfer a single itunes song to it. sure, it says it's possible, but after days and days of trying to convert this and uploading that, i just gave up. a big waste of money.   
it's a good item. i haven't tried any other mp3 players so i have no basis to compair.   it caught my eye with the color screen, which is really nice to have some graphics on your hip. the user interface is real easy to use. i have yet to read the manual and i have no reason to. the audio quality is nice. the little bud earphones give sufficiant sound quality. i like the image viewer. it could use a couple more cool features to utilize the color screen. more graphics or such. it has a screen saver function and it'd be nice to use a custom image. audio options are excellent. you can adjust just about anything.   it's small, light weight, very versitle and easy to use. it comes with a good ammount of accessories.  i have nothing really negative to say about this product. it's real good and i'm happy with it except i'd go for the 1 gig @ 200 instead of 512 @ 150.   cheers! ;d  
i too can relate to all of the reviewers who can not get sound.  slim devices drops my wireless signal about every three minutes.  it is very rare that it will play a whole song.  i have tried a linksys g router, a us robotics router, and now a d link router.  i am not using other wireless resource while it is playing besides my latop.  all of my other wireless devices show "excellent" signal strength while this thing can not seem to locate a network.  customer support said it was my router's power settings.  i am on my third router from three different manufactures and i think it is the sqeezebox.  i would recommend passing on this product as i am sitting here playing mp3s on my laptop speakers looking at my squeexebox screen stating its usual "problem, can't find a wireless network" message.  
works great, but drains battery life rather quickly i think. very handy to have around when you need a usb flash drive.  
while i enjoy the increased memory for more music and the recognition of more file types, i miss the old buttons i had on my 512. buttons simply offer more tactile feedback than the membrane areas (i guess that's what they're called) on my newer m250. sometimes these membrane areas don't respond and the a-b function i bought this unit for?; fugget about it! it's very difficult to isolate small segments of music with the new membranes. this is very important for me to learn a piece of music by ear. if i had known about these drawbacks prior to buying this 'new and improved' model i never would have bought it.  
pros: easy set up..easy song and pic transfer..lcd screen has excellent quality..transfering songs can be done numerous ways..ie...software..wmp..drag and drop in explorer..sound quality is very good  cons: doesn't have the ability to make a playlist without connecting to the pc..supplied headphones sounded very good but where a bit large and hard to get to stay in my ears(i suggest koss "the plug" or koss "the sparkplug" earbuds   
i never had to use customer support, that's why it gets four stars. wow i have owned this wonderful toy for a year never had a problem with. i have dropped it! it rebooted and rebuilt the library. it does so much. records, records your favorite radio programs too. (think felix hernandez) keeps data and photos (no video) create play lists whatever suits your mood. it's like walking around with your own theme music. an equalizer, choose your list random or planned. play all or play some. adjust the volume. oh and another thing get your own headphones. creative gives you an excellent product then gives you really cheap ear phones. but if your thinking of buying this at 8gb think twice and get more than 3 times as much space for the same price.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b000ea8u12/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-2427411-7001231">creative zen sleek photo 20 gb multimedia player (aluminum/white)</a> same price but get more, more more! a  little larger, same functions but at 20gb you'll lose your mind and make extensive use of amazon's very varied music library.  
i've had this about 2 weeks now, and i'm really happy with it.  i was able to use all the advertised features within minutes of opening it up.  i also downloaded all my music using the drag-and-drop feature which is a must-have if you don't want some proprietary software converting all your files and then deleting them (i've had this happen!)  most of the files i have are ripped from cd using software for the zen stone since i had some problems finding anything simple for the zen nano plus. the radio is better than the one in my car, and recording both the radio and lectures is very straightforward.  there's only one minor problem with this player (for the price) and that's it's shoddy case.  don't get me wrong, it's the right size and heft, but within one day the plastic crevices were caked in dust and it looked like the two halves are trying their hardest to split apart.  i might have to duck tape it together because i want this player to last me at least a couple years.  
i bought this player to take on a trip.  i knew that i would be away from a computer, could not "recharge" the battery so that took away the ipod line that requires access to a pc. this unit has a single aaa battery.  i bought a pack of lithium aaa batteries for the trip and knew that i could always buy more if needed.  (at home i use rechargeable aaa batteries so the cost for playing is minimal.)  for the two week trip, i loaded my player with old time radio shows, 2 audio books from audible.com (each one more than 25 hours of play) and lots of music. to use the books, i had to connect to the manufacturer's website and upgrade the installed software. took minutes. once i did, the books worked great. could even bookmark my spot and come right back in.  the 13 hour plane flights and days of train travel was made even more pleasant with this little player. the books tend to use more battery time than music, but i still got more than 20 hours of play from regular alkalines and close to 30 on lithium.  the sound quality is superior to some mp3 players i tried, even without using the built-in graphic equalizer. i used the regular earbuds it comes with for a couple weeks (very nice quality) then switched to a lariat style headset so i only had one set of cords around my neck.   the buttons are large enough and spaced well so the controls are easy to use. the backlit feature is adjustable in brightness and for how long it stays on. plugged in a set of speakers (available at any drug store for portable cd player) to this unit at my office and so everyone can here what is on my player.  i highly recommend this player!  there is nothing missing on this player. you will not have to settle when you get this player.    
before i start with my mini review, let me first clarify some things:  1. this device support mp3 drag-and-drop without using sonic stage using a program provided by sony. see the following links:  sony: http://www.sonydigital-link.com/dna/common/asp/details.asp?l=en&v=mp3installer_2_0&m=mp3 how to make it auto-launch: http://forums.minidisc.org/index.php?showtopic=11234  2. this device works as a regular flash drive. it lets you copy non-audio files.  mini review:  having used a sony minidisc player before, i'm used to sonic stage already. one thing i don't like about it is, there's no mac support. sonic stage is not really hard to use. i look at it as, it's not as easy as itunes.  it comes with 5 free songs (gift cert) at sony connect. the upload of the songs to the device was a bit slow since it's usb 1.1. a good thing about sonic stage though is, you can choose what songs to upload to your music device (apple added this feature when the shuffle was released).  although just one color (light blue), the oled screen is great. think of an lcd screen but brighter (it makes me want to get the sony clie vz90). all devices with screens should use oled! :d  the metal controls require getting used to. it reminds me of the small dial at the side of an analog watch -- pull once and twist up or down to scroll through the songs, pull it one more time and twisting up or down scolls through the albums, push it in and it's on 'hold' and controls are protected from accidental pushes or twists.   on power saving mode, when a song is playing, after a few seconds, the screen turns off. every after a few seconds thereafter, an animation - like four "(" - runs to show you that something is playing.  battery life - i have no plans of testing it but the box says it will last 50 hours of continuous playing. the box also says that a 3-minute charge is good for 3-hours use (wow). charging is done via usb through the computer by the way.  as for weight, it's slightly heavier than the shuffle.  there is an option to adjust bass and treble. using good earphones makes it sound really better than the shuffle.  purchased music are in atrac3 format, though it can play mp3, wma, and wav files if you upload them via sonic stage.  earphones, usb cable, belt clip, a black pouch, and a 5 free song sony connect coupon are included in the box.  as for the cost, the e507 (which has 1gb) is $199 - the 1gb shuffle is $129. is the $70 difference worth it? knowing that sony included an 3-liner oled (not just a regular lcd) screen is well worth it already. it also comes with an fm tuner and a clock. while it says at the the back that it was built in china, the build is solid. i highly recommend this device.  some images side-by-side with the ipod shuffle (see third reply): http://www.1src.com/forums/showthread.php?p=834041#834041  
let me say this is my fourth ipod. got my first one about 2 1/2 years ago with the 3rd generation. i. got it replaced after about 2 years as the battery died quickly. they replaced it with a 30 gig photo ipod. then when the black nano came out, i just had to get it! love it except everything scratches it, including cotton pants! thats the only downside to the nano. then yesterday at the san francisco apple store around noon the new ipod with video came out and i snatched it. its the white 30 gig (thats all that was availible). the thing is spectacular and the picture quality is awesome. the plastic front looks like its made of the same material as the nano so i'm being extra cautious and actually put a screen protector over it that was made for my compac ipac. it works great. you just have to cut it to fit over most of the ipod and the scroll wheel still works great with the plastic over it.  the bad news is the battery only lasted 1 hour 45 minutes as i just tested it with a full battery. barely enough for a movie but the ipod is mostly used for music. i can use my psp for movies.  you have to buy the plug in adaptor as this model along with the nano does not come with one but thats understandable as the units are fairly reasonably priced compared to other mp3 players and the first ipod was only 5 gigs, this is really a deal. my nano is black and the screen protectors works great for that one too. apple's computers aren't the best but i think their mp3 players are!  
i really like this mp3 player overall.  it doesn't hold a lot for those that want to puit multiple albums on their player but for me it was plenty.  it does seem a little confusing to operate but i am getting the hang of it.  
note: this yp - u3 will not work as a usb drive. it used to work, then samsung & microsoft teamed up to update the firmwire in this device, it can not be used as a usb drive now. and it only work on windows xp (not even 2000), no linux, no mac.   and you will need admin privilege to install the driver. (so if you want to transfer file between computer, this thing won't work).   i am it engineer so i did a lot research on this and managed to update the firm ware. but it is such a hassle. i won't buy this thing if i know in advance it won't work as a usb drive.   i repeat, it will not work as a usual usb drive. you will have to install drivers on the computer. the description in amazon in not accurate.   if you have a firm ware early than 1.07, it might work. most of them are 1.11 now.   hope this will save you some money and time.    
just bought my p-2000 yes, i'll be using it to transfer cards while on the road. i shoot 2000 frames a week doing destination weddings.   i also wanted to use it to watch movies; i fly alot. anyway... i read many reviews saying it was very difficult to create a file it would accept. this was true until now. if you own this unit and want to watch your favorite film simply get video vault pvp edition. google "video vault" and you'll find it.  working with the program is super easy, video quality is fantastic. i now travel with no fewer than a dozen movies. too cool.  
the creative nano sucks. 4 hrs and 2 calls to tech suppoert and the unit still will not be recognized by my computer. one of the tech support help points was to use one of the usb ports on the back of the computer rather than the front (not in the instructions). they say that the ports on the back of computers are more capable that those on the front (?). i asked them why they would design a device - with a 6 inch cable - that required you to crawl under your desk to plug it in each time, when there is a perfectly good port (that works for every other plug-in device i have) on the front? all i got was a sheepish, 'yeah, i know' from the techie. still did not work on the rear port. then they wanted me to go in and do some monkey work with the computer's register. forget it. it goes back. it's like buying a radio for your car and then being told you need to work on the transmission to get the radio to turn on. what a piece of crap.  amazon should have an option to rate '0 stars'.  
well!! well!! well guys. what we need is a sleek, perfectly designed, aesthetically pleasing, great sounding player for music. thats what the latest ipod photo is. photos? thats a goodie. well what i am trying to say is, you cant compare it to any other mp3 players in the market. ipod is in a league of its own.  a device that does one thing perfectly and for long, is what we need. offcourse we could have a camera on it, a voice recorder may be, am/fm ow thats a must!!, cell phone? make it an organizer....how about a microwave? yea rrright... i have played with most of them.....iriver, zen, sony...the all in one paradigm of thought, eventually leaves us with none in one. being a hardware designer myself, i wouldnt buy an all in one device. take the ipod in your hand look at it, play it, use it...you will realize that this was created by a buncha cool dudes with passion for design, looks & music. they certainly had problems in their earlier versions. this device shows that they really have made an effort to overcome them to please you. not merely make it a 'throw in more' competition. i think i see a remarkable betterment in the quality and fedility of the music output. a 20g can hold a lot of songs in its stomach. i wouldnt use it for file storage because you can assemble a 100gb pocket disk that requires no battery, power or recharging for $150. so, i wouldnt go for more than 20gb ipod. no wonder it is so popular.   so, go for it!! you'll enjoy it.   
pmc 120 wasn't worth the $100 i spent.  music quality is fair but glitches frequently.  i've been unable to make it through an entire video without the player freezing.  the picture quality is low and did not meet my expectations.  
it is a great gadget to have for the summer. i love the size of it. i am glad i purchased it. i enjoy having it at my gradma's house this summer. she does not have to listen to loud music since i have my ipod.:)  
this is the worst product i have ever bought. the software is the most inefficient software ever. it always freezes my computer and its also very inaccurate. this product itself also happens to freeze, and the response timeing is very slow. not a very good quality product at all. if u want this product to show off then its fine for you, but otherwise it is the wrong choice because of these problems i have encountered.   
i purchased this for my teenage son for christmas. the one we received had a faulty processor or something and would not run videos properly (would skip and stall) and the videos would have poor audio.  i give 2 thumbs up to amazon for the quick processing of the return.  the conversion time for putting the videos in zen format was quite long too.  i replaced the returned zen with a 30g zune for my son (again from amazon) and he's a happy camper showing me "see, this is how a processor should run a video!" for the ones the zen had trouble playing.  positives: small size, the size is much better than my bulky 30g ipod. is ours was defective and my son plays mostly videos with a few songs, i don't know how it'll fare for just music, but the size is a big plus.  negatives: was how it ran my son's videos.   
"flawed fatally" and "sonicstage suicide" are pretty much right on in their appraisals.    the hardware is awesome.  i don't regret getting this gem.  i just squeezed 20 albums on this puppy with roughly 250+ songs.   and the battery life is spectacular - sony must employ some of the best power management experts on the planet.    however, and this is the big frustrator, the sonic software is the worst piece of crap i've ever used, going back to the dos days of the '80s.  it's horrendously slow (almost like watching the grass grow), weirdly inaccurate (in it's gauges showing transfers), unintuitive, and basically a scam (my opinion) to get you out to their website to sell you more music.   btw, since the instruction manual says you can't drag-and-drop mp3s and have them play, and since i tried this and it in fact doesn't work just as the folks at sony truthfully say, don't believe that you can despite what other reviewers here say.  what you can do is drag-and-drop files, so you could use this as a portable memory stick, but they really don't play... at least i haven't been able to get them to play.    in summary, however bad the software is, the hardware is still amazing and i hope that i won't have to interact with the software too often.  i even went out and downloaded the latest software from the 'net, so don't think this is just an outdated review and new software might be available.  i suggest to sony that they skip from version 3.2 straight to 5.0, fire all the developers of the present software and go get a team who can whip off something worthwhile.  and, develop drag-and-drop for mp3s.  
i had it for about a week.  had to reset it 20 times.  sending it back.  previously i had a samsung 5gb mp3 player.  never had this kinda problem or any problem for that matter.  i plugged in headset into the device and the screen went blank (white).  there was no volume and the function buttons stopped working.  i then attempted to reset the device, that did not work.  i had to let the device sit for about 30 min and it began working again.  then i went to creative's website thinking this was perhaps a software problem.  after updating the software (which the version was already current) the problem continued.  could not find a tech support telephone number on creative's website.  finally i contacted amazon and they are sending me another one.  after sleeping on it, i want a refund instead.    
some of the other reviewers complained of poor audio quality, and if you just start using the player straight out of the box, i agree, there's a lot of distortion.  but after my adjustments, the player has pretty good audio quality - here's what you do.  play a song that has a lot of distortion.  from the main menu, go to equalizer > 5 band equalizer.  adjust the levels until there's no distortion.  it takes a bit of fiddling but i think 2 minutes of fiddling is worth it for good audio from a cheap player. ;)  on to the review!  i purchased my rave-mp arc (the 2.5gig version) refurbished for $85.  physically the player is well-designed, the buttons are for the most part clearly labelled and it's not difficult to figure out what they do.  though the player is not metal, it still feels like it's sturdily constructed; i've already dropped it and spilled yogurt on it and it barely skipped a beat.  the size of the player is average, about the same size as a candy bar cellphone (though a bit thinner.)  this is something you can slip in your pocket easily, unless you wear very tight pants. ;)  since this is a hard drive player, i wouldn't expect it to stand up to strenuous activities like jogging or mountain biking, but so far it's done fine for me with walking and exercise biking.  i've yet to look at the manual.  the menu layout and operation of the player is very intuitive and easy to use.  i got a little confused on some parts but quickly figured it out.  the battery life is also excellent so far - i use this during my 8 hour work day (usually listening for 4 or 5 hours) and i've never drained the battery below 50%.  transferring files is a snap too, i just use it as a flash drive and drag-and-drop to the player from my computer.  indexing takes a bit of time, but it's nothing too bad.  i did take a star off for the earphones.  this player came with two sets and both aren't that great.  the big 70s style ones were comfortable, but also broken, they distort the sound horribly.  the earbud style ones aren't that comfortable, but they are fairly good with the sound.  expect to invest in a quality pair of headphones.  as for other accessories, the belt clip is a little bulky but entirely usable.  the arm band is very handy when exercising too.  overall so far, i find this to be an excellent deal for my money so far.  it holds a lot, is pretty durable, has good audio quality (after adjustment), a long battery life for a hard drive player, and is easy to use.  i'd recommend this player to anyone who likes to listen to music at work, on trips, or while doing light exercising.  now i get to see how well it stands the test of time. :)  dec 20: after 2 plus months of owning the player i can safely say i was not disappointed with my purchase.  the battery life is still stable and long, and the player still works fine.  the only problems i've had so far are: it will lock up if you try to record when the drive is full (there is a reset button to fix this.)  also, the protective plastic over the player screen is not airtight (also not dust tight!) so my screen is looking quite dusty and i have no immediate way to clean it.  i'm looking into how to clean it off now!  but overall, i still feel it's a good investment, especially if you can get it refurbished or used.  feb 2, 2006: still working!  and the battery is holding up fine, i usually get 8 hours of it easily.  i still haven't figured out how to go about cleaning it... but i haven't really tried. ;>  november 16, 2006: over a year later and it's still working.  i use it about 4 times a week when i exercise now, and i find i have to recharge... maybe once every 2 weeks.  so the battery is still holding up well.  the buttons are getting a little sticky, but i suspect that may be because i do bad things like leave it in a freezing car overnight.  considering the amount of torture this thing gets, it's holding up remarkably well.  
after careful consideration of sites like napster and other download music file "to-go" types. the iaudiox5 will not be recognized or music files(drm)will not play. even when the firmware is upgraded to 2.11_b1. also if you have windows xp the drive has to be formatted in fat32 and the max partition is 32g leaving a wasted partition that the iaudiox5 firmware will not use for file storage because it is designed for a single partition. so if you need to "wipe" the iaudiox5 drive windows 98(se)can do this upto 2t in fat32 or a third party software on windows xp os (although it needs to port through usb2.0 as well). ntfs formatting will not work! as the firmware is written to look at fat32 sectors. other than that this unit has many features and functionality that surpasses any ipod!  
besides the owners manual, and the few problems you might encouter, the mini is great. despite what other reviewers have said, i have had my mini for about two years, and the battery still seams perfect(i've never done a full battery life check) as for finding out how to upload, download, and use the mini at first,it's a little more tuff. i still love the mini.  
i am what you might call a newbie when it comes to mp3 players. i've been an avid mp3 downloader for years but have always just played them off my pc or burned them to cd for my car. i have recently decided to make my music more mobile and i have to say that i'm not completely thrilled with this mp3 player.  when it comes to the operation of the player and the sound i'm more than happy with it. once the songs are on the system it's easy to make it do what i want it to do. as for the sound quality it seems to be great just as long as you buy a different set of head phones (at least for me), as the ones that come with the system are ear buds and are horribly uncomfortable and fall out constantly.  the only thing i don't like about the mp3 player is a great downfall. as i stated before i'm a newbie and thought that you could just plug this guy in then 'drag and drop' the mp3's you want onto it (like a thumb drive), oh was i wrong. they include this "sonic stage" software with the player and you must use it to get the mp3's onto your player and oh my does it suck. first thing i hate is the fact that it does not display my song library the way it should and instead has it all jumbled into a knotted mess. next is the fact that this thing only seems to agree with my desktop running windows xp and not my laptop which unfortunately running vista ultimate.  in the mean time i will keep this player but when i get the chance i'm going to get one that doesn't have such horrid software.  
the new apple ipod with video playback brings a much anticipated facet of technology to the pocket portable world.  with the capability to playback crisp and vibrant video in both h.264 and mpeg-4 formats, the new ipod enables you to take your shows on the go.  matched with the new quicktime version, creating your own movies for play on the ipod is just as easy!  the new flat-faced, slender design not only brings a new asthetic quality to the orignal ipod line, but also brings it together with the recently released ipod nano.  the new, smaller scroll wheel, no longer sporting a rounded center button, fits the overall design much better as well.  the face of the new ipod features the same clear laminate coating that the ipod nano was treated to, serving to both protect the new 2.5" screen better and allow the ipod to be produced not only in the original white, but the new and decidedly appealing black.  the new 2.5" screen holds to the same apple quality most have come to expect.  clear, bright and easy to watch at nearly any angle.  while many compare this to the sony psp's larger screen, the two technologies serve decidedly different needs, and the ipod executes its purpose well with the design.  all in all, the new ipod is the same old great functionality and design with the ability for video added in.  the "icing on the cake" as steve jobs put it. [...]  
just got my mine in the mail from amazon.com, plugged it in for a battery charge, loaded all of my favorite songs at the same time. and now, i am listening to each one of them. the quality of the sound is very clear and loud if you wish it that way. it's got a shuffle functionality which works perfectly if you go to the gym and don't want to listen to only one album. the little device is so light too. i mean. 5 stars is well deserved for it. lastly, the 14 hours of battery is true. :) enjoy!  
i bought this for my sister and she loved it, as well as myself. i got mine months ago and still using it.  functionallity is great, no problems at all; sound is good and fm reception is neat.  i highly recomend this product, small size and oveall features are awesome.   
this is a great unit with a major design flaw that nobody talks about.  the battery is irreplaceable!!!!!  it is a lithium ion so if you made the mistake of buying one don't let the battery drain completely--it prematurely ages it.  i'm appalled i made the mistake of buying one!!  it is virtually a disposable mp3 player!!!  
i've been using it on a daily basis for more than 1 year already and it's really great. absolutely no glitches so far (i've dropped it on the floor several times), great battery life !  
excellent little product; really nice sound quality in a small package; controls are adequate, though could be a little larger.  the small display is ok - - would be very nice if the backlight stayed on a little longer (of course, that would eat the battery faster)  works great, holds a bucketload of songs and a great little package.  
the following review is only interesting for photographer:  the main reason for me to buy the product was to backup and store photos from my canon to a harddisk and have a fast viewer for the photos. i shoot the photos in .jpg and .raw format.  i upgraded my archos 504 from the former av 420 which did support .jpg and .raw backup from my canon, but the photo viewer was incredible slow.  you don't find any information about storing the .raw format on your archos... i bought the product in the believe that an upgrade can't mean a step back in the development... which was an error... it really dont support .raw ... i asked the helpdesk if they plan to support the .raw file in future... their answer was no, they decided against raw format.  nevertheless the picture viewer and the video things work fine, just for those who want to store .raw files as in the past, forget it...  thanks archos, so you make it easy for photographer to change the backup system to other companies like creative.   
machspeed trio 1 gb mp3 player also a 1gb flashdrive i have no complaints it works great. i recommend it  
i purchased this product just a little over 3 weeks ago and it has already given me problems. one of the selector buttons doesn't always respond and i don't think it worth the time or money to send back to get this reoccuring problem fixed. i don't recommend this product to anyone.    
i am the unhappy owner of several h10's and initially there were no problems, but the closer they got to the end of the one-year warranty, the more problems they all started having.  problems include freezing up for no apparent reason, scrolling in chinese, and the most irritating is when the "system files are missing" and you have to reinstall the firmware and redownload all of your music.  the company doesn't believe in customer service - you can't get through on the phone and they take days to respond to email.  i have returned two because the hard drives crashed and it took 3-4 weeks to get them back, and then one of them crashed again as soon as i got all the music redownloaded and i had to return it and wait another 3 weeks.  i have a problem with one that has now gone out of warranty and iriver told me they won't touch it and to look for a repair shop online.  so save yourself alot of headaches and time, not to mention money, and don't buy an h10 player.  
this is a great mp3 player.  i love that it is so small and simple.  i wish that they were more readily availiable.  i also love that it is rechargeable and i'm not running through batteries like crazy.  
this thing got sooooo annoying. it took literally hours to figure out the stupid thing even with reading and rereading the instructions included with each one. it doesn't help if you have done it before or not. i got mine months ago and wanted to update to newer songs and everytime i tried i just get frustrated and want to throw it out the window. it will not download different songs or let me even get to the step that you can actually manage what songs are on it and which ones aren't. the library is hard to figure out and it doesn't work at all with window media player, making it very difficult to get the songs i want on the device. i am usally farely patient and i just cannot stand this thing!!!the alarm clock freezes up a lot and i have almost been late for school. how it functions really has no rhyme or reason. one day it works and the next, it just doesn't. it doesn't hold enough songs, the radio doesn't come in clear, you can't just slip it into your pocket, the alarm doesn't always work, it takes for ever to get to your music once you actually get the thing turned on, you can't rewind or fastforward songs, and i've spent hours upon hours trying to get the songs i want on it. i think tha ti'm just going to get a small cheaper mp3 player with more space for songs and one that works better with windows software. anymore it just sits on my dresser and does nothing because it's all old songs and the alarm isn't reliable.~~~it is not worth it!   
i bought it about 2 mounth ago and l?ked ?t very much ?ts sound qual?ty very good but th?nk ?t comes from my bose tr?pod headphones :)  
i bought 2 of this for christmas one worked for 33days the other one never did. got refund on one, the other can't because warranty expires in 30 day, and player got dead on the 33rd day.  bottom lines, crappy player, don't buy it!!   
i bought this product after doing alot of research, and have been very pleased with the performance.  it actually works as a napster to go compatible product, so transfer of playlists, etc is very easy.  i've found that the easiest way to copy movies is to use my dvd player, and that works well.  i've got about 100 songs, 250 photos (at 5mp resolution), and 7 full-length movies and still have 70gb of memory available.  battery life has been okay, the included earphones need improvement, it's a good idea to buy the extra power/charging cord for travel.  i travel to hong kong regularly, and the movies on the airlines are unsatisfactory, so i'm looking forward to enjoying this on my 14 hour flight!!    
this was my grandson's present last year from his mom and dad.  he loves it  
i am not reviewing how this works b/c i am sure it works as well as all other ipods but......i am shocked how expensive it is for a 4gb player.  i know its an ipod so it will be expensive but you can get a 20gb player (non-ipod) for about the same price, maybe a little more.  it is clear that you are not paying for gbs here but style.  i understand that but it still seems like a high price to pay for fashion.  i just want to listen to music!!!!!  
regretfully, i bought an h10 20gb some time ago.  within the first couple months it died so i call iriver and made arrangements to send it back.  it took several weeks to get it back.  the one that came back was dead out of the box.  i spent about 3 days trying to reach iriver to send this one back.  the guy i spoke to told me that this item was seeing a lot of defects and returns.  that was about 1 month ago.  they said they sent a replacement - it never got here?  now i cannot get any response from iriver.  i like to go to stores to see products then go to amzn for the prices - iriver's stuff is not anywhere to be found in any of the major chain stores...  these guys are going out of the game....   
like many of you i spent a good deal of time to deciding on which portal media device would best suit my needs. ultimately i decided on the archos, primarily because it was repeatedly said that it's, "probably the best option for those who could afford it."  why i like the av500: one of the best features of this device is that it allows other mass storage devices to be connected to it. what this means is that i can connect my external usb 2.0 hard drive to the av500 and it will let me copy or even play directly from the extenal hd. this allows you to use regular hard drives effectively boosting the allowed capacity - also allowing multiple drives holding different kinds of data (for instance, i have a ton of tv series and movies on an 80 gig external hd). this usb option also allows me to conect my sd card reader to my av500 and copy to and from my sd cards. i can do this anywhere, and where i use my dell axim to watch movies and listen to music, i can change out my 1gb sd in my car or at work.  the capacity is fantastic even on it's own (i needed something that would hold my collection of over 40gigs of mp3s).  the viewing angles this device supports are fanatastic. when i was showing it to people they didn't have to all cluster together into one massive hydra to see the screen. it supports mass storage mode - thus becoming an external usb hd.  why i don't love my av500: the hard key controls are difficult at best, especialy when you're used to a pda's touch screen often when i'm moving or copying i wish i could just press the button (and sometimes i forget i can't).   the buttons - yes, this deserves a second mention. they feel shoddy and breakable. they also are not recessed making them easily pressed, especially when attempting to close the carrying case.  the carrying case - i guess you can say it's better than nothing at all, but that's not a compliment. you can't close the case with the headphone jack in - other owners might disagree with this, and i have been able to close it with them in, however, a quarter of the time i was able to squeeze it shut i ended up pressing a button (the cover lays on the buttons as they, again, aren't recessed). closing the case in general (headphones in or not) you tend to press a button accedentally. the case could best be explainned as a "keep from scratching when it's in your bag" solution. i would have liked to see something with a latch where you can wear the av500 on your hip or what not - mostly for walking or transport. as an update: the lid to the case can flip over and, using the same button/latch that keeps it shut, instead allow it to act as a stand.   it's lack of mutlitasking support is extremely annoying! it baffle's common sense trying to figure out why this option was left out. i'd love to be able to browse through my pictures while listenning - or put on a nice slide show. you can browse the hd structure, but attempting to interact with the folders or files at all (for instance, renaming) will result in the music being stopped.  i expected it to display a picture (perhaps one named "folder.jpg") in the same folder as the music is being played. it does display an embedded image from the mp3 if the file contains one - this is the future of mp3, but still, support for the past and not requireing me to go back over all my albums and re-encode them with an image would have been nice.  it's not a portable option. it's bulky and heavy; it's button's... yeah, i mentioned this twice already; tt's screen is very easily smudged - it's not an ipod! i don't mean this as a bad thing, but i bought it to compete with the ipod, instead of a portable media player, i got a portable media center - if it had wireless b or g support i would marry it! but i would not take it to the gym and i would not even attempt to run with it. if you could see it more as a hub or base of operations for your media experience, you'd be better off.  summary: it's not as portable as the other devices thus you'd likely need some other device (with mass storage mode support) to get the full pmp experience, and use the av500 as a base of operations transfering music back and forth. it's price is very reasonable for what it does. i don't use it's dvr features so i can't comment on this aspect. it's interface is dodgy (though the iconic display is nice) - why no touch screen? i'd have paid the extra for this option.  if you don't need this for when your on the go or at the gym, grab it and enjoy!   
i will never - ever - buy anything from philips again.  this purchase was a christmas present for my son.  within a few days of opening it and following all the instructions to the letter, the screen fried, making the unit unusable.  i contacted customer service, and a very helpful agent gave me a support tag number and shipping information.  it was all a ploy.  philips took their sweet time sending out a replacement unit, and when they did, they gave us an expected delivery date that has long since passed with absolutely no concern about the status of the delivery.  their attitude is, "hey, we shipped it to you."  philips' customer service is, in a word, shallow.  they cannot tell you who they used to ship replacements, and that department doesn't much care.  instead, they have to put in a request for a tracking number which can take an additional three business days.  we have already spoken with the vendor.  as soon as this thing ever gets here - if it does - it's going back for a refund and we'll buy a different mp3 player from a company that can at least pretend it knows what it's doing.  
i bought a machspeed trio 512mb nearly 2 years ago and it is working just fine - still!  so, to the reviewer who thinks the people giving a good review are probably reviewing after just taking their product out of the package and reviewing with one days use, i think you are not being fair and your comment is out of line.  maybe this device works differently than others (?), but it does work!    i just purchased another unit for my adult daughter to use when she works out and bought the larger memory, same unit.  since i plan to give her a "gadget basket" full of modern technology for xmas (she still uses floppies...) i was trying to keep the prices in line and why i chose this device.  i wanted to set it up for her and load it with mp3 files so that when she opens, it is all ready to play.  i suppose the saavy factor should be the other way around but ironically, i am an older person who has had experience with gadgets and my daughter - d/t her lifestyle and studies, is only just beginning, and why i wanted to get her set up.      upon opening the package i plugged the unit into my pc usb and opened as a removable drive.  amongst the software and such pre-loaded onto the drive, there were 2 pre-loaded songs that played on my pc just fine.  next, via drag and drop, i loaded up the unit with mp3's, closed the drive, removed from my pc usb, added a battery to the back of unit, turned it on and proceeded to set up the device.  additionally, i chose the white background as i find the colors make the text difficult to read.    maybe i should have read the directions (and i am female, lol...sorry guys) but i did not and relied on my intuitive skills...  initially, i was a bit frustrated until i discovered how to use the rocker switch atop the unit but after that it was smooth sailing!  i don't care much for the sound quality via the supplied earbuds, they lack the features of a decent set of buds - but that seems commonplace with "almost" any device with supplied earbuds.  with that in mind, i purchased better quality buds for a reasonable price and resolved that issue; said and done. of course it would be nice to have quality buds come with the device, but this is not an ipod and that was not to be the case, plus, i liked the inexpensive pricing!  better buds come in an assortment of pricing that is not outlandish.    it seems to have a bit of a delayed start-up and the menu took a bit of patience to scroll through, learn and set up - but if old me can do this, i would venture to guess most anyone can tackle this too.  this player is all plastic and feels like you'd want to handle with care and hope to not drop.  maybe even get some kind of a clip or velcro fastener strip for carrying.  with my older player, the usb cap lost it tight grip and would easily slip off and i suspect this device will do the same.  a piece of masking tape holds my end cap on (ugh).  my older player has some scratches in the casing, but otherwise, plays very well and lately, i have been using it as a portable storage instead of dedicated music player only b/c my cell phone conveniently has mp3, fm and voice record. this device works both ways if you outgrow it's memory size, or whatever...  also, with both players, i find it too easy to erase songs, thus keep back-ups loaded on my pc just in case that happens. or you could say that i only copy my songs to the device verses moving the file.   additionally, there is a "hold" switch on the "bottom" of player for lock and unlock that can easily be bumped and one might want to keep that in mind.  as well, upon set-up there is an option to how your files will play, so make sure you have that set to your choice so you aren't left wondering why another song won't play, or not playing in order.  optionally, one can plug this device into a portable speaker unit to enjoy your music while in the bathroom, fixing your hair and getting ready, or whatever may apply!  overall, this player does exactly what it claims to and with better buds, sounds even better.  i like it and don't understand what all the fuss is about.  for this price, i'd give it 5 stars if it came with better quality buds...but then the pricing would go up!  
while a little expensive, we have been able to load it up with are kids favorite dvd's, and tv shows (and a few of our own) to make travel much more enjoyable.  it is very easy to use.  
before this one i had an iriver 899, which had lots of customizing features, allowing the user to change recording bit rate, turn the back light off, etc.  i bought this, thinking thta it may be comparable.  i am disappointed. 1.  even though the specs page in the manual says that the recording time can go up to 18 hrs (at 32 kbps), there is no way to get the recording bit rate lower than 96 kpbs.  there are just 3 settings for recording bit rate and the lowest is 96kbps.  the 899 had many different sampling rate and bit rates for recording.  plus, on the t30 you can only record in stereo.  the result: large files which are inconvenient to email, etc. 2.  you would think they would let you turn the dang backlight off if you want, but you can only get it down to 3 seconds.  that wastes a lot of battery life if you don't need it on.  battery companies must be wining and dining iriver or something. 3.  there are other things on the t30 that iriver has started to cheapen, and for this reason i give the device a low rating.  
i have used a laptop and portible dvd player to view videos and prefer my av700 to both hands down. the unit is about the size of a paperback book. it turns on in seconds. the screen in no different from the lcd on a laptop or dvd player. for convience, it is unmatched. on a windows computer with xp, the unit is recognized as an extra hard drive making it easy to drag and drop video and music files. during playback of a movie, you can easily "mark" where you stop and the unit can return to that point when you it turn back on. i keep about 30 movies on it at any one time and still have room to spare. the unit works seamlessly with amazon's video download service. when transferring a file, windows will tell you if the file is not compatible with the unit and refer you to windows media player, which will convert and download files for you. all in all, using this is a "no brainer". it's easily the best gift i've received in years.   
this flash drive seemed like a great idea.  unfortunatly, the player has trouble playing most of the music files i transfer to it from my ibook.  the company says its compatible with apple computers, but normally the player will only play a handful of the songs i transfer to it!  
i have had the sansa for 3.5 months now, and have had no major complaints. works well, easy to use, battery life is above average(i am still on 1st battery, and i use mp3 all the time). it is great for running or working out, won't skip like some hard disk mp3 players.   is it the best sound in the world? no. but it is adequate, and other buds or headphones can be purchased. the only thing i would change is the playlist function. but putting songs in folders in order and renaming can fix this. it really does not bother me at all. how many entire albums are you going to listen to in a row anyway? most times it is used while exercising, on the subway, on a plane, etc.  overall, i highly recommend this little guy, you won't be disappointed!   
i love the archos for many reasons, first it's easy to use. who ever designed it had common sense. also you can edit parts out of shows that you don't want, you can place a book mark where you stop watching a show so you can go right back to the same place when you turn it back on. you can title the show, create different folders to organize your recordings. you can load pictures from your camera very easily, you can create a slide show and view them on the 7 inch screen. the sound from the speakers isn't the best but when you use head phones it sounds better than a movie theater. i reccommend getting the 100 gb hard drive because better more space than not enough, it claims it holds 250 movies but that must be at the lowest resolution. i record one down from the highest resolution because that is about as low of quality that i want to watch and when you do that you use a lot more drive space. it also has great battery life. i am very happy with the archos av 700, it hasn't given me any problems, no glitches or freeze ups. i did however go to the archos website and download the most recent firmware update as soon as i got it. i do not regret buying it for one minute, a little pricey but if you have the money, go for it!     
just returned my second av500.  first one would not charge / turn on. technical support told me to exchange it.   second av500 seemed to work but had to use tv pod to get a/v in (awkward). then after recording a video file i was not able to transfer it to my computer. small files will transfer but not the larger one. technical support was not able to explain the error message shown. tested on multiple computers.... lost important video footage. gave up.  
the 20gb photo ipod uses a superb audio computer chip that surpasses the current ipod classic model and previous ipod video models.  the bottom line is that i previously owned  the 5th generation 30gb video for 18 months. i replaced it with the 4th generation 20gb photo ipod it sounds better in my car and on my bose digital sound dock. i purchase an mp3 player for sound quality not looks. hopefully apple will improve the audio computer chip for the current ipod models. until then if you want cd quality sound you cannot go wrong with the 4th generation 20gb photo ipod.  
i purchased this unit in late february and within a week it malfunctioned.  the unit turned on with the "locked" displayed eventhough the "hold" switch was in the off position.  i couldn't do anything with it other than turning the unit on and off.  when i called samsung tech support, it took them less than thirty seconds to diagnose the problem; they already knew about the defect.  my conversation with them gave me the impression there were many returns from the early releases of this unit.  the unit i purchased was manufactured in january 2005.  (for those considering purchasing this unit, note that there's no way to find out the manufacturing date until after you open the package.  the date stamp is on the back of the unit.)  i sent my defective player in for repair and received a refurbished one back.  i was dissappointed at paying so much for a new unit only to end up with a refurbished one.  the other reviewers were lucky to get a working player; i was not so lucky.  
great features, great construction, great concept.  what's wrong then?  battery life is abysmal.  i'm talking 30-40 minutes when the device was brand new and running on a full charge.  in my opinion it's pretty much unconscionable to ship a portable music player that isn't really portable for more than 30-40 minutes.  even with the wifi turned off it's not much better.  contrast this to my 5th generation ipod (which the sansa was intended to replace) which gets 13-20 hours per charge.  i never even worry if it's charged or not, it always just seems to have plenty of battery life.  i was excited to receive the sansa connect, even told all my friends about the concept of unlimited downloads.  sadly i'm very disappointed with the product.  i don't think it's worth paying a subscription fee to yahoo music when the device isn't even portable -- i could just stream music for free if i wanted to be tied to only places with power available.  the other very bad thing about this product is that if you are already a yahoo music jukebox user it's nearly impossible to get the software for the sansa to work properly.  unlike with an ipod where you just plug it in and it offers to transfer your songs, i had to uninstall, reinstall, delete songs, re-download songs, etc. etc.  it was a total nightmare.   also, if you don't sync it frequently enough it gets screwed up and you have to reload everything.  yahoo offers no helpful tech support either.  i'm someone who loves the concept of drm'ed subscription music.  i don't like the idea that i need to back up my itunes library, and was looking forward to switching to this device.  sadly it is no substitute and i regret buying it.  
i just got my 6 gb mini for my birthday.  i also got most of the accessories as presents, too, so i don't have to worry about forking over the cost of the mini itself for them (seriously, mac).  i am in electro love!  wow, and i think this time it's for reals.  :-)  i am coming fresh off the iriver boat (funny how they use the "i" in front of their name, too), and have been extremely pleased with my little 256 mb player... and i do mean little.  but, i am extatically (word invention there) adding album after album on my ipod as i type this.  yeah, it's kinda annoying to convert wma files to aac, but they do the work for you.  i love the organization, i love the style, i love the size, i love the balance between form and function.  i do feel like i've just joined a cult of ipod users, however.  oh well, not as bad as mormonism  
the sandisk sansa view is a pretty nice player from a hardware standpoint. its build quality is solid, it looks nice, and it has good sound quality if you don't use the stock headphones. admittedly, it's nothing flashy, but it isn't meant to be - it's a low cost, high capacity mp3 player.  it has one huge failing, however, in the quality of its firmware. it crashes and, despite claims of long battery life, the player only lasts about six hours on a full charge with the latest firmware. considering i purchased this player for work, that makes it virtually useless to me unless i feel like sitting in silence the last few hours of my shift.   i actually returned one of these thinking that the battery was defective, when in fact the players only manage about 17% of the battery life sandisk claims. if you don't update the firmware, the problem isn't so bad. i managed about twelve hours on a full charge with the factory firmware, but it had issues with crashing that forced me to update it.  anyone considering this player might want to give it a few months before jumping on board. it's not bad, but the firmware needs a lot of work. needless to say, i'll be thinking long and hard before i purchase a sandisk product within a year of its launch in the future...then buying something else instead.  it saddens me, honestly, because i really like the player itself. its simple design really is elegant, the screen is large and clear, and the navigation wheel makes maneuvering menus a breeze. if it could swing even half of the battery life that sandisk claims, i'd be perfectly happy with the view, but it is very far off the mark. as things stand now, i'm seriously considering a refund to purchase a player from a different manufacturer.  
emergency do not buy this piece of junk freeze all time complicate intructions this is the worth mp3 i ever and ever bougth ......................please do not buy  
my daughter was so happy to get this for her birthday!  it worked well and we downloaded numerous songs for her.  she used it a few times every week and carried it with her to keep her from getting bored in the car when i wanted to listen to my music.  the last time she used it she put it in her jacket pocket & zipped it up.  we really aren't sure why the lcd screen looked like we dropped it in water because it stayed dry.  it just stopped working. that's too bad, because it seemed like a nice product.  should've lasted longer than 4 months!  
i wasted $240 on this piece of junk. stopped working after the pitiful 3 month warranty ran out (of course). freezes up and crashes 90% of the time, have to remove the cover, then remove the battery to even restart the thing. i will never buy a creative labs product again! stay away from this thing!!!  
this produc was delivered earlier than expected and in great shape.  my family loves having an ipod to enjoy their favorite music.  great service and a great item.  thanks.  
i bought my player from costco a few months ago. i love the thing to death. couple things to improve on... a protective skin would be a nice option, and an expandable memory. i love this player for it's compactness, however the memory is just okay. when i bought this product i thought it would be perfect for me, small and lightweight, but only room for approx. 120 songs. it fit a reasonable amount of songs on there, but not all of my collection. one of my only complaints is that mine wouldn't do a playlist, which is fine for me, it would have been a nice feature. i love the "on the fly" radio recording and the voice recording, for notes, ideas and thoughts. all in all, this is a great beginning product.  
great price but very hard to use, you can spend 15 minutes just trying to escape the menu. be nice to have better volume control.  
this product is compatible only with microsoft windows xp.  creative has really fallen short on what could have been a nice product by choosing to offer drivers for only one operating system.  if you have windows 2000/me/98, don't waste your time with this product.  there is absolutely no way to transfer files to it.  i had one, tried it, and sent it back for a refund.  
very happy with the product so far and it looks like a new mp3 player. i am pleased with your service.  
this mp3 player is small,it sounds good and has some great features.  it has everything the more expensive brands have.  i called them to check out the warranty and they said, if anything goes wrong within 12 months that they will repalce it for free.  sounded like a good deal and it works well. i'm happy with the decision i made.    
been using it for a year now and never had any problems, battery life is excellent, but i think i bought too much of a capacity have used only 27gb max ;)...  my best buy so far!  
pros:  - field backup of your photos  - nice display  - easy to understand and use (compared to, say, your camera)  cons which, if corrected, would put it in the 5 star:  - slow to load from cf to internal hdd  - no external battery charger  - cannot zoom in on camera raw files  - price $200 less (might as well dream)  4 stars.  worth owning.      
the zen micro looks great to me, better than the ipod mini and equal to the rio carbon.  pros: +5 gb seagate drive +great sound quality (all of creative's players) +synchs with outlook +looks cool +removable battery  cons: -requires software to transfer music -no tactile buttons, all touch sensitive.   and to the fool zip, iriver was out before the ipod, so your point is moot.  
not someplace i would buy from again.  the product does not work as described.  we have attempted to contact the seller.  the phone only has answering machine for a message and they never return the calls.  we contacted toshiba and they sent new discs and everything to try and fix the machine and then told us to return it to the seller.  we are still trying to do that with no success.  "beware"  
i love this mp3 player.  it looks great and the sound quality is excellent. i have had no problems using the software that came with the player.  it was easy to install and use, and if i can use it anyone can.  it takes about 5 minutes to import a complete cd onto my computer.  i don't feel that is an unreasonable amount of time. the battery on this thing is amazing.  it is easy to charge and lasts forever. i have never owned another mp3 player, so i can't compare it to any other players out there. the only complaint i have is that the earphones that come with it are very uncomfortable.  i would recommend this player to anyone.  it is awesome!   
we bought this to use with the rhapsody-to-go service. we'd been waiting a while for a compatible flash player and so we were excitied to see a bunch of them come out about the same time. we went for the t30 because we'd had good experience of iriver players in the past.  overall - we're really pleased with this player. sound quality is very good as is normal with iriver players. the controls are a little counter-intuitive, but fine with a little practise - another iriver trait.  only real issue was getting it set up to work with rhapsody-to-go. this involved an upgrade of the rhapsody client (which was straight-forward), and a firmware upgrade of the player (which should have been straight-forward but wasn't). everything's working now but only because i'm a techie geek. non geeks might have struggled.  oh - and to all of the reviewers that complained about the non-compatability with windows 2000, its because modern music services like rhapsody and napster use drm software for copyright protection and it isn't available for your obsolete operating system. windows 2000 was replaced five years ago - its a bit unfair to mark down a product because you've decided not to move with the times.   
this is a great first time mp3 player. the price is well worth it considering other 20gb players cost far more. the music is easy to download and takes virtually no time at all. plus you it holds pictures.  make sure you have all the latest software and the players works like a charm.  there are quite a few snags but nothing too bad (it freezes up). the resest button clears it up with no loss to memory. plus my experince with their customer service was really pleasant. i called them with a problem and had an answer and my problem fixed in under 5 minutes. i thought it would be a more tedious process because of what i read from other reviewers but i had a great experience.  again i would recommend this to any first time mp3 owner or second or third time owner.  
i love the ipod when it works, but i have had three die on me out of the blue.  i have taken care of all of them.  they have not been dropped or exposed to high or low temperatures.  it's easy to get them replaced if you pay extra for applecare.  that's definitely worth it.  if you have not already invested in getting your music onto itunes, look closedly at other mp3 players before getting locked into ipod.  at this point, i have 6000 songs rated on itunes.  it would take too much time to switch.  
i got the muvo n200 for christmas. i previously had a samsung yp-35, and was more than satisfied with it. however, this blows the yepp out of the water. here's a list of some of the pros and cons i have found with the player.  pros 1. the volume range is great. i have never had to turn it all the way up, so you wont have a problem with it being too quiet like some other players. 2. the folder starage is great. instead of scolling throught a couple hundred songs, i can just go through a dozen or so folders. 3. great size. the thing is tiny 4. the button interface on it is very well laid out. i can use it in my pocket, without haveing to worry about hitting the wrong thing. 5. the recorder and microphone are great. i particularly liked that you could change the bit rate right on the player. (bit rate: higher bit rate= better quality, but larger file, and vice-versa.) 6. the line in ias a great feature. 7. really easy to use. just copy and paste your files. 8. completely customizable equalizer. 9. great options for the player's diplay. reversible screen, contrast, etc.  cons 1. like some other people commented, there is a buzz in the background when the light is on. however, you only barely notice if the volume is at lower than 23 or so. (the volume goes up to 40) 2. the ear phones, while they do sound pretty good, are huge. they definetly are not the most comfortable things in the world, but they soung pretty good, and you can always replace them.  overall, i think that this is definetly an awsome buy. personally, i don't think i will ever regret it. however, i've only had it for one day, so i'll change my review if anything comes up in the future. but as of rightnow, it is great.   
this small, portable music player is quite fascinating. it is composed of a synthetic byproduct of petroleum, known by most as plastic, though the exterior shell seems to be composed of a thin sheet of brushed aluminium (ai, atomic number 13). the "plastic" from which this device is constructed appears to be of the highest quality, however, when closely observed, i found it to be softer than desired, thus, it scratches easily. it plays music that is downloaded to it via a computer, either macintosh or pc. this may be a deterrent to those of you who do not own a computer. when playing the music, it uses small phonic devices inserted into the ears. these are called "headphones". due to the nature of these "headphones," dogs cannot listen to your music. when listening to the music, i found it to be of satisfactory quality. this device has a large storage capacity which is its primary selling point. if you buy this device, you should be sure to have music to download to it, otherwise, there will be nothing to listen to. the music that i recommend is wagner, tchaikovsky, and puccini. i find this music to be of superior quality, and worthy of listening to.  
the size of the player fits perfectly in my hand and the pink color is cute too. the menu button is easy to use except the hold feature is little bit annoying. i am still trying to figure out how to use the sonicstage software. but for anyone who wants to listen mp3 format music, it is better to download the mp3 file manager software from sony website. you can use the drag and drop feature once you download the software to your player. but i am only able to drag music files from my mp3 music cd which i don't know why. overall the player works great once you figure out how to load music to it.  
wow this baby is sooooooooooo nice. i don't have any comments at all other than the software it comes with is clunky, but just dl from sonys web page and its much easy to use. i do think 512mb is a bit small, so maybe go for the 1gb instead. i love this thing, its perfect for when i workout or play poker. the hidden usb plus is the coolest feature about this gadgets, it is spring loaded behind a small little door. man this is nice. give it a try!   
creative have a long legacy in digital sound their media players are much more versatile than the ipods of this world. this player has everything. it is small, has all the features you would expect plus some extras like a superb voice recorder and the ability to take line-in audio and split it into separate tracks. the only thing this audio player does not allow is naming the fm stations on the tuner, but that's it! i have 3 of these in the family (two black one white) and a zen vision:m (also awesome) - creative rules!  
best little hard drive based player i've found.  i base this off the comparisons with ipods, dell dj's, larger creative players, irivers and other players that lack that "je ne sais quoi" that i was looking for.  i have an older 5 gigabyte zen micro that i really like (so does my wife), so i purchased the 8gb microphoto for her.  it is everything the micro is and just a little better in all ways.  naturally the color display is the highlight here as well the increase in storage capacity.  i might note that the microphoto is slightly thinner (about a millimetre) than the 5 gb micro, yet it still has a choice of many different face colors.  it has lost none of its nice feel in the hand that was there before, in fact it was so well liked by my nephew and two nieces that they asked for them for christmas.  i take that as major praise for the design since teenagers have quite the opportunity to see different players, especially the ipod!  also important to me is software and where i can purchase from online sources.  this is important if you want to buy from napster and others.  ipod=itunes store for online music purchase, in fact you should check the online source to see if your player is compatible.  i have both windows and macintosh computers and i still choose a windows device (maybe microsoft is on to something!!).  also the rechargeable battery is replaceable, i have replaced two ipod batteries for a friend on an older second generation ipod (not something i'm fond of) and when another friend's newer fourth generation ipod's battery began losing capacity i couldn't find  instructions on how to dis-assemble it, he brought it back for service for $85.00 and a day's wait, not for me!  the creative software works well and is a good tool for organizing your zen microphoto's music and files.  i could not use my old zen micro explorer with the zen microphoto, no problem though, both versions of software run fine together!  the software is a piece of cake to use and the 8gb microphoto transfers files about 3 times faster than my old zen micro, i assume a faster hard disk is in the new machine.  the sound is breathtaking and you may use one of eight pre-set equalizer settings, your own custom setting or you may disable the eq function if you wish.  currently there are five zen micros in our family, four 5gb micros and one 8gb microphoto, they all work perfectly and i am very pleased with them!  i have read in some reviews regarding complaints with the headphone jacks, the newer ones do seem to have a different connector on the end of the headphone; however, we haven't had  trouble with any of them!  
i have the nexus 25 but assume the same problem exists in the 50. when listening to a recorded xm channel, the player automatically drops out (cuts off) the last couple of seconds of each song and the first second or so of the next song. this means you lose the last few notes of every tune and the first few of the next one. this is extremely jarring if you are used to the normal radio listening experience, since like most radio stations, xm's songs are played in a continuous mix without break, meaning normally the next song starts as the previous song fades away without interruption. even more noticeable is when this happens during spoken moments such as station ids or jingles. instead of hearing "the history of alternative music, fred on 44", you instead only get "istory of alternative music, fred on fo" or instead of "american top 40 with casey kasem", you hear only "rican top 40 with casey k". it is just ridiculous and there seems to be no way around it.  
i was initially very excited about this product. it is very light weight and ostensibly ideal for runners. it's meant to be used by athletes. however, it has broken 3 times now, all when running. when i run with it, either outside or on the treadmill, it gives of electrical shocks! the first time, the shock was so strong that the whole player shorted out and i had to send it back to be fixed - it wouldn't play anymore! this was just one week after i got it. the second time, just the headphones got damages, but they had to be replaced, because no sound came through them anymore. this last time, the shock was so bad that half of the internal memory was wiped out, and it no longer supports the external memory card. i would not recommend this player to someone who is looking for something durable and reliable.  
true to its promise it is a great music player and the itunes software is intuitive and makes it easy to create playlists.  the enclosed earbuds are so-so - but it does work as promised, and in my case needed a large chunk of the 60gb though in total between photos and music using about 26gb - so unless you own 500+ cd's 60gb may be more than you need.  the photo bit works as promised but while the screen is sharp the pictures seem a tad fuzzy to me, and while the concept of a slideshow is nice not really using it that much.  also haven't used the tv slideshow feature which would probably make me like the photo bit more.  i think there is a way to store the whole photo file not just a cut down version - so it becomes sort of a backup.  but i have too many photos to do that for.  i also bought it to store my contacts/calendar - and they make it sound easy.  well perhaps for mac users - but for a pc user regardless of my trying to use palm desktop or outlook the contact feature doesn't seem to work and the process is horribly explained - just plain awful.  also one note of caution - if you are going to carry it around in bag or pocket probably worth getting a cover/case.  almost immediately i noticed a small scratch on the screen - i was obviously not being careful enough.  unless you treat with kid gloves - get a cover.
